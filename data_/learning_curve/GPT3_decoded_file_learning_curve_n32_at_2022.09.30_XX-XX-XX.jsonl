In this study, we employ a multi-particle Monte Carlo approach to simulate the non-linear transport of electrons inside the semiconductor bulk. All possible scattering events of hot electrons in the medium, the main details of the band structure, as well as the heating effects, are taken into account. The results presented in this study derive from numerical simulations of the electron dynamical response to the application of a sub-Thz electric field, fluctuating for the superimposition of an external source of Gaussian correlated noise. The electronic noise features are statistically investigated by computing the correlation function of the velocity fluctuations, its spectral density and the variance, i.e. the total noise power, for different values of amplitude and frequency of the driving field. Our results show the presence of a cooperative non-linear behavior of electrons, whose dynamics is strongly affected by the field fluctuations. Moreover, the electrons self-organize among different valleys, giving rise to the reduction of the intrinsic noise. This counterintuitive effect critically depends on the relationship among the characteristic times of the external fluctuations and the temporal scales of complex phenomena involved in the electron dynamical response. In particular, the correlation time of the electric field fluctuations appears to be crucial both for the noise reduction effect and the appearance of an anomalous diffusion effect.",

Mater. Chem. A 7 (2019) 18,135\u201318142). Under these conditions, the well-known instability of this material against carbon dioxide and humidity can be minimized, potentially allowing its application even in hydrocarbon-based atmospheres. Nonetheless, electrochemical transport properties of grain boundaries of BCY are still not well understood. Hence, we compare specific grain boundary conductivity and space-charge properties of BaCe0\u00b79Y0\u00b71O3-\u03b4 (BCY10) in both wet and low humidity by means of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 100\u2013300 \u00b0C. In H2, specific grain boundary conductivity increases in nominally dry conditions, while the bulk remains practically humidity independent. Conversely, in O2, both bulk and specific grain boundary conductivities are higher in wet. The space-charge properties highlight that low levels of humidity, pH2O ~10\u22124 atm, are sufficient to maintain functional performance, while providing enough stability.

Molecular doping has been proven as an effective way for graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) to extend its light harvesting and improve its charge separation and transport, while little attention has been paid on its effect on the charge transfer at the interfaces between GCN and the cocatalyst. Herein, a pyrimidine-based molecule, 2,4-diaminopyrimidine (DAP), was first used to combine with urea for preparing doped GCN. It is found that the optimal doped GCN sample, CN-DAP 36 , has a narrowed band gap, reduced photoluminescent emission, and longer carrier lifetime, as compared with the undoped GCN. The hydrogen evolution rate of the doped GCN is found to be 2.80 mmol/(h\u00b7g), 6.09 times that of the undoped GCN [0.46 mmol/(h\u00b7g)] under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, according to theoretical calculations, the pyrimidine groups in DAP possess a stronger adsorption capacity for Pt particles than the tri-s-triazine of GCN does, thus leading to more Pt particles deposited near the pyrimidine rings. The extension in optical absorption, the reduction in charge recombination, and the enhancement in charge transport, along with the facilitation in the interfacial charge transfer from the doped GCN

The active region of this detector is defined by the pn-interface region of a highly doped GaAs homojunction. The cleavage plane normal to the interface defines a line detector with high spatial resolution. The actual resolution was tested using a near-field scanning optical microscope. An Al-coated tapered optical fiber of nominal aperture of 60 nm was scanned in the optical near-field vicinity across the active region of the junction. The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction. The width of the observed peak in photocurrent is found to be highly asymmetric with respect to the p or n side of the junction.
