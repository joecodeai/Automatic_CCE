[{"doi": "10.1007/s10853-017-1104-8", "title": "Comparison of chemical bath-deposited ZnO films doped with Al, Ga and In", "text": "A comparative study is presented on chemical bath-deposited ZnO films, doped with the group-13 metals Al, Ga and In. The study reveals marked differences in dopant incorporation in the films, which increases in the order: In, Al and Ga. The presence of dopant in the solution induces significant modifications in the deposition rate, which varies between 110 and 40\u00a0nm\u00a0min\u22121. All films are (002)-textured, whereas the lattice stress evolution with the dopant type and concentration suggests that Ga has the highest degree of substitutional incorporation in Zn sites. The average visible transmittance is higher than 80%, while the infrared reflectivity depends on the free carrier density in the films, which is the lowest for undoped ZnO and increases in the order: In-, Al- and Ga-doped ZnO. Optical measurements also yield an inverse correlation between carrier density and mobility. Doping enlarges the bandgap, as well as the Urbach energy that is related to the films\u2019 disorder. The lowest electrical resistivity, measured by four-point probe, is 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm and is obtained for In-doped films after being exposed to ultraviolet light. Ga-doped films are found to exhibit the highest stability of the conductivity upon ultraviolet exposure.", "doping_sentences": [{"sentence_text": "Comparison of chemical bath-deposited ZnO films doped

The fabrication process has been designed to allow the integration of such infrared emitters with an array of thermopile infrared detectors, with the aim of achieving an integrated non-dispersive infrared microspectrometer. A first set of infrared emitters with a common size for the doped silicon radiating slab (1,100 \u00d7 300 \u00d7 8 \u03bcm3) has been successfully fabricated and characterized. The working temperature of the Jouleheated radiating slabs has been controlled by means of DC and pulsed electrical signals, achieving temperatures well beyond 700\u00b0C. The thermal time constant measured in pulsed operation, around 50 ms, is adequate to enable the direct electrical modulation of the emitted radiation up to a frequency of 5 Hz while maintaining the full modulation depth.

The results presented in this study derive from numerical simulations of the electron dynamical response to the application of a sub-Thz electric field, fluctuating for the superimposition of an external source of Gaussian correlated noise. The electronic noise features are statistically investigated by computing the correlation function of the velocity fluctuations, its spectral density and the variance, i.e. the total noise power, for different values of amplitude and frequency of the driving field.

There are unperturbed sites similar to those observed in Pr2CuO4. Next, there are perturbed sites, also reported previously for Pr2CuO4, whose concentration increases with cerium doping. The perturbation can be described by a local deformation identical to that observed earlier in the similar compound Nd2\u2212xCexCuO4. This deformation is also presumed to be responsible for the 580 cm\u22121 Raman active A1g local mode observed in Pr2CuO4 as well as in the other Ce-doped 214 cuprates. The third type of Pr3+ site, observed only in the Ce-doped compounds, is tentatively ascribed to local inhomogeneities provoked by trapped electrons. Also, in contrast to previous Raman and neutron studies, the pronounced 125 cm\u22121 feature is found to be the low energy Eg symmetry phonon rather than a CF excitation.", "doping_sentences":

"Effect of humidification on the grain boundary conductivity and space-charge effects in yttrium-doped barium cerate", "text": "Yttrium-doped barium cerate (BCY) exhibits proton conductivity in the nominal absence of water (pH2O \u2264 10\u22124 atm) below 450 \u00b0C (J. Mater. Chem. A 7 (2019) 18,135\u201318142). Under these conditions, the well-known instability of this material against carbon dioxide and humidity can be minimized, potentially allowing its application even in hydrocarbon-based atmospheres. Nonetheless, electrochemical transport properties of grain boundaries of BCY are still not well understood. Hence, we compare specific grain boundary conductivity and space-charge properties of BaCe0\u00b79Y0\u00b71O3-\u03b4 (BCY10) in both wet and low humidity by means of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 100\u2013300 \u00b0C. In H2, specific grain boundary conductivity increases in nominally dry conditions, while the bulk remains practically humidity independent.

The formation of crystalline ternary compounds is inferred from the X-ray diffraction pattern of these films. Their structural and optical properties are studied by reflection spectra in a wavelength range of 300\u2013600nm. The films have a direct band gap, which varies from 3.7eV for zinc sulfide to 2.45eV for cadmium sulfide. Films with a narrow range of composition were found to be stable in Na2SO3 solution under cathodic or anodic polarization in dark and illuminated conditions. This potential interval allowed to determine the flat band potentials from capacity measurements in the dark, which indicated strong contribution of double layer capacitance, surfaces states, and non-uniform doping concentration. Electrochemical impedance measurements where further performed, giving detailed information about the relevance of these factors and the optimum composition of coupled semiconductor films for

the performance of CdTe-based semiconductor devices. Arsenic is a promising p-Type dopant; however, reproducible doping with high concentration is difficult and carrier lifetime is low. We systematically studied defect structures in As-doped CdTe using high-purity single crystal wafers to investigate the mechanisms that limit p-Type doping. Two As-doped CdTe with varying acceptor density and two undoped CdTe were grown in Cd-rich and Te-rich environments. The defect structures were investigated by thermoelectric-effect spectroscopy (TEES), and first-principles calculations were used for identifying and assigning the experimentally observed defects. Measurements revealed activation of As is very low in both As-doped samples with very short lifetimes indicating strong compensation and the presence of significant carrier trapping defects. Defect studies suggest two acceptors and one donor level were introduced by As doping with activation energies at ~88 meV, ~293 meV and ~377 meV. In particular, the peak shown at ~162 K in the TEES spectra is very prominent in both As-doped samples, indicating a signature of AX-center donors. The AX-centers are believed to be responsible for most of the compensation because of their low formation energy and very prominent peak intensity in TEES spectra.", "doping_sentences": [{"sentence_text": "Self-compensation in arsenic doping of CdTe.", "sentence_cems": ["arsenic", "CdTe"], "relevant": true, "gpt3_completion": "\nThe doping of CdTe with arsenic is done to improve the electrical properties of the semiconductor.\n\nThe doping of CdTe with arsenic is done to improve the electrical properties of the semiconductor.\n\nThe doping of CdTe with arsenic is done to improve the electrical properties of the semiconductor.\n\nThe doping of CdTe with arsenic is done to improve the electrical properties of the semiconductor.\n\nThe doping of CdTe with arsenic is done to improve the electrical properties of the semiconductor.\n\nThe doping of CdTe with arsenic is done to improve the electrical properties of the", "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": [-1.9166121, -2.2749999, -2.3294861, -1.5408874, -0.5983314, -0.0042672795, -0.026938856, -1.2414247, -0.2768057, -1.5000443, -2.0792992, -1.1283833, -1.6857729, -0.557669, -1.9359596, -0.86124283, -0.35566637, -0.40805236, -1.3346993, -0.011168773, -0.25650612, -0.53474146, -0.0259469, -2.093955, -1.3748846, -1.0177836, -0.37489814, -0.0012267113, -0.0067480113, -0.28007352, -0.045498468, -0.5952798, -0.357716, -0.4686745, -0.32349202, -0.15024611, -0.087705046, -0.047679413, -0.15292555, -0.24373099, -0.089382075, -0.00087133347, -0.24026096, -0.38555574, -0.041446652, -1.3239112, -0.51332766, -0.13038126, -0.079253756, -0.0008637576, -0.0031014092, -0.07400861, -0.008577092, -0.17684513, -0.045443136, -0.06755117, -0.044086754, -0.057058237, -0.032391217, -0.035441007, -0.04590501, -0.07526969, -0.03462617, -0.0010152343, -0.065034196, -0.13405718, -0.033867244, -0.5866147, -0.10806299, -0.01824285, -0.015846977, -0.000524134, -0.0017733934, -0.013761031, -0.0037727805, -0.04384877, -0.01104865, -0.011606038, -0.011470191, -0.011512939, -0.0075521413, -0.013425758, -0.011597355, -0.030277323, -0.012086811, -0.0004789305, -0.01919876, -0.11815313, -0.0376853, -0.67456007, -0.06394822, -0.0112443585, -0.008727937, -0.00039187065, -0.001161306, -0.006849251, -0.0025310528, -0.021471271, -0.006678283, -0.006446755, -0.0068694735, -0.006432537, -0.0037025416, -0.0088732755, -0.0077680065, -0.011411948, -0.006796921, -0.00031227022, -0.013399054, -0.11005361, -0.023119247, -0.6044039, -0.046610236, -0.00758145, -0.0060165976, -0.00029533787, -0.0007771417, -0.0044008973, -0.0020077867, -0.015151531, -0.005099021, -0.004853961, -0.0045144726, -0.004702438, -0.0023966692, -0.006383049, -0.005558036, -0.008122462], "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": ["\n", "The", " doping", " of", " C", "d", "Te", " with", " arsenic", " is", " done", " to", " improve", " the", " electrical", " properties", " of", " the", " semic", "onductor", ".", "\n", "\n", "The", " doping", " of", " C", "d", "Te", " with", " arsenic", " is", " done", " to", " improve", " the", " electrical", " properties", " of", " the", " semic", "onductor", ".", "\n", "\n", "The", " doping", " of", " C", "d", "Te", " with", " arsenic", " is", " done", " to", " improve", " the", " electrical", " properties", " of", " the", " semic", "onductor", ".", "\n", "\n", "The", " doping", " of", " C", "d", "Te", " with", " arsenic", " is", " done", " to", " improve", " the", " electrical", " properties", " of", " the", " semic", "onductor", ".", "\n", "\n", "The", " doping", " of", " C", "d", "Te", " with", " arsenic", " is", " done", " to", " improve", " the", " electrical", " properties", " of", " the", " semic", "onductor", ".", "\n", "\n", "The", " doping", " of", " C", "d", "Te", " with", " arsenic", " is", " done", " to", " improve", " the", " electrical", " properties", " of", " the"], "entity_graph_raw": {"basemats": {}, "dopants": {}, "results": {}, "doping_modifiers": {}, "dopants2basemats": {}}}, {"sentence_text": "Efficient p-Type doping in CdTe has remained a critical challenge for decades, limiting the performance of CdTe-based semiconductor devices.", "sentence_cems": ["CdTe", "CdTe"], "relevant": true, "gpt3_completion": "\nThe first sentence is a statement of the problem.

Molecular doping has been proven as an effective way for graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) to extend its light harvesting and improve its charge separation and transport, while little attention has been paid on its effect on the charge transfer at the interfaces between GCN and the cocatalyst. Herein, a pyrimidine-based molecule, 2,4-diaminopyrimidine (DAP), was first used to combine with urea for preparing doped GCN. It is found that the optimal doped GCN sample, CN-DAP 36 , has a narrowed band gap, reduced photoluminescent emission, and longer carrier lifetime, as compared with the undoped GCN. The hydrogen evolution rate of the doped GCN is found to be 2.80 mmol/(h\u00b7g), 6.09 times that of the undoped GCN [0.46 mmol/(h\u00b7g)] under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, according to theoretical calculations, the pyrimidine groups in DAP possess a stronger adsorption capacity for Pt particles than the tri-s-triazine of GCN does, thus leading to more Pt particles deposited near the pyrimidine rings. The extension in optical absorption, the reduction in charge recombination, and the enhancement in charge transport, along with the facilitation in the interfacial charge transfer from the doped GCN sample to Pt, contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the doped GCN.", "doping_sentences": [{"sentence_text": "Insight into the Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Activity of

This technique, in combination with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), often provides an opportunity to observe unexpected phenomena. However, the amount of transferred charge and the corresponding change in the electronic structure vary significantly depending on the material. Here, we report study on the correlation between the sample work function and alkali metal induced electronic structure change for three iron-based superconductors: FeSe, Ba(Fe0.94Co0.06)2As2 and NaFeAs which share a similar Fermi surface topology. Electronic structure change upon monolayer of alkali metal dosing and the sample work function were measured by ARPES. Our results show that the degree of electronic structure change is proportional to the difference between the work function of the sample and Mulliken's absolute electronegativity of the dosed alkali metal.

The active region of this detector is defined by the pn-interface region of a highly doped GaAs homojunction. The cleavage plane normal to the interface defines a line detector with high spatial resolution. The actual resolution was tested using a near-field scanning optical microscope. An Al-coated tapered optical fiber of nominal aperture of 60 nm was scanned in the optical near-field vicinity across the active region of the junction. The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction. The width of the observed peak in photocurrent is found to be highly asymmetric with respect to the p or n side of the junction. The reason for this asymmetry is discussed in terms of diffusion length of minority carriers in the n- and p-GaAs close to the suface. \u00a9 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
