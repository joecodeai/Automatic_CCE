Through detailed experiments, it has been deduced that ultraviolet (UV) light is a major factor in the degradation of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance due to generation of surface defects in nanoporous TiO2 and dye structural modification with free radical formation. We describe a simple spray deposition method to coat europium doped yttrium vanadate (YVO4:Eu3+) down-shifting (DS) phosphor nanoparticles (NPs) on the front side of DSSCs in order to enhance photocurrent and mitigate UV induced degradation. The nanophosphor provides an enhancement in short-wavelength spectral response of solar cells, and long-term stability is also improved under illumination, due to down-shifting of high energy UV photons to the visible region.

The optimum preparation conditions of NS-MAG particles were researched and determined. Then the permeation fluxes of NS-MAG/PSF membranes with different doping amount of NS-MAG particles were tested. NS-MAG/PSF membrane, SiO2/PSF membrane, and PSF membrane were prepared respectively. These membranes were characterized by testing the tensile strength and the permeation flux. The results show that doping NS-MAG particles can better enhance the tensile strength and permeation flux of PSF membrane. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.", "doping_sentences": [{"sentence_text": "Preparation of Nonstoichiometric Silica with Multi-Active Groups and Effect of Its Doping on Polysulfone Membrane Capabilities.", "sentence_cems": ["Silica", "Polysulfone"], "relevant": true, "llm_completion": " The host 'Polysulfone' was doped.\n", "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": [-1.676031e-05, -1.9980816e-05, -4.277735e-07, -0.0024833675, -3.076318e-07, -1.7400124e-06, -1.8841804e-07, -0.40738842, -1.8841804e-07, -2.0966954e-06, -7.1719274e-05, -1.8601542e-06, 0, -0.0008370333, -7.4639065e-06, -0.9243791], "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": [" The", " host", " '", "Poly", "s", "ulf", "one", "'", " was", " d", "oped", ".", "\n", "\n", "END", " OF"]}, {"sentence_text": "Nonstoichiometric silica with multi-active groups particles (NS-MAG particles) were first synthesized, and then added to the porous matrix of PSF to prepare a NS-MAG/PSF composite membrane through a phase inversion process.", "sentence_cems": ["silica"], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}, {"sentence_text": "The optimum preparation conditions of NS-MAG particles were researched and determined.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}, {"sentence_text": "Then the permeation fluxes of NS-MAG/PSF membranes with different doping amount of NS-MAG particles were tested.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": true, "llm_completion": " The host 'PSF' was doped with 'NS-MAG'.\n", "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": [-0.00038650344, -1.0204763e-05, -5.460492e-07, -0.00017103326, -7.1958624e-05, -0.04134371, -5.460492e-07, -4.277735e-07, -5.037998e-05, 0, 0, -7.815842e-05, -6.827632e-08, -3.4089344e-06, -0.0013079975, -6.827632e-08, -7.159913e-05, -9.130952e-06, -0.42927423, -1.5261258, -0.27658018, -0.24651377, -0.106819324, -0.00018939328], "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": [" The", " host", " '", "PS", "F", "'", " was", " d", "oped", " with", " '", "NS", "-", "MAG", "'.", "\n", "\n", "END", " OF", " GU", "ID", "ANCE", "\n", "\n"]}, {"sentence_text": "NS-MAG/PSF membrane, SiO2/PSF membrane, and PSF membrane were prepared respectively.", "sentence_cems": ["SiO2"], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}, {"sentence_text": "These membranes were characterized by testing the tensile strength and the permeation flux.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}, {"sentence_text": "The results show that doping NS-MAG particles can better enhance the tensile strength and permeation flux of PSF membrane.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": true, "llm_completion": " The host 'PSF membrane' was doped with 'NS-MAG particles'.\n", "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": [-0.011956868, -0.00015636964, -6.827632e-08, -1.7953334e-05, -3.076318e-07, -0.0055811713, 0, 0, -6.6619094e-07, -6.432833e-05, 0, 0, -9.370307e-06, -6.827632e-08, -4.2433903e-06, -0.0040193703, -1.9765537e-06, 0, -4.859278e-05, -5.912312e-06, -0.053649213, -1.566178, -0.19511522, -0.44357982], "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": [" The", " host", " '", "PS", "F", " membrane", "'", " was", " d", "oped", " with", " '", "NS", "-", "MAG", " particles", "'.", "\n", "\n", "END", " OF", " GU", "ID", "ANCE"]}, {"sentence_text": "\u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.", "sentence_cems": [], "relevant": false, "llm_completion": null, "gpt3_logprobs_numbers": null, "gpt3_logprobs_tokens": null}]}, {"doi": "10.1016/S0927-0248(02)00242-8", "title": "Structural, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of screen-printed and sintered (CdS)\n                  x\n               (ZnS)1\u2212x\n                (0<x<1) films", "text": "Sulfides of zinc and cadmium have been used effectively in various optolectronic devices and recently as photocatalysts in the production of molecular hydrogen in photoelectrochemical processes.

The active region of this detector is defined by the pn-interface region of a highly doped GaAs homojunction. The cleavage plane normal to the interface defines a line detector with high spatial resolution. The actual resolution was tested using a near-field scanning optical microscope. An Al-coated tapered optical fiber of nominal aperture of 60 nm was scanned in the optical near-field vicinity across the active region of the junction. The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction. The width of the observed peak in photocurrent is found to be highly asymmetric with respect to the p or n side of the junction. The reason for this asymmetry is discussed in terms of diffusion length of minority carriers in the n- and p-GaAs close to the suface. \u00a9 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
