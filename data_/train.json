However, the potential of lanthanide doped upconverter materials is typically limited by low absorption coefficients and low upconversion quantum yields (UCQY) under practical irradiance of the excitation. Modifying the photonic environment can strongly enhance the spontaneous emission and therefore also the upconversion luminescence. Additionally, the non-linear nature of the upconversion processes can be exploited by an increased local optical field introduced by photonic or plasmonic structures. In combination, both processes may lead to a strong enhancement of the UCQY at simultaneously lower incident irradiances. Here, we use a comprehensive 3D computation-based approach to investigate how absorption, upconversion luminescence, and UCQY of an upconverter are altered in the vicinity of spherical gold nanoparticles (GNPs). We use Mie theory and electrodynamic theory to compute the properties of GNPs. The parameters obtained in these calculations were used as input parameters in a rate equation model of the upconverter \u03b2-NaYF4: 20% Er3+. We consider different diameters of the GNP and determine the behavior of the system as a function of the incident irradiance. Whether the UCQY is increased or actually decreased depends heavily on the position of the upconverter in respect to the GNP. Whereas the upconversion luminescence enhancement reaches a maximum around a distance of 35 nm to the surface of the GNP, we observe strong quenching of the UCQY for distances <40 nm and a UCQY maximum around 125 to 150 nm, in the case of a 300 nm diameter GNP. Hence, the upconverter material needs to be placed at different positions, depending on whether absorption, upconversion luminescence, or UCQY should be maximized. At the optimum position, we determine a maximum UCQY enhancement of 117% for a 300 nm diameter GNP at a low incident irradiance of 0.01 W/cm2. As the irradiance increases, the maximum UCQY enhancement decreases to 20% at 1 W/cm2.

Diamond process development requires parallel development in characterization techniques such as ultra low energy SIMS (uleSIMS), especially in the ability to depth profile for impurities and dopants at high depth resolution. As a contribution to the background knowledge required, we have measured the sputter yields of single crystal high pressure high temperature (HPHT) diamond using O2+, Cs+ and Ar+ primary ions in the energy range 300eV to 2keV. We compare these with yields for silicon and GaAs. We show that the erosion rates with oxygen are \u223c10 times what would be expected from ballistic processes and essentially energy independent in the measured range. This result agrees with the anomalously high sputter yield observed in the ion etching context. Conversely, positive ion yields for elements such as boron are very low in comparison with silicon.

Oxygen-doped carbonaceous materials have the potential of high capacity and super rate performance. However, up to now, the reported oxygen-doped carbonaceous materials usually exhibit inferior electrochemical performance. To overcome this problem, a high reactive oxygen-doped 3D interdigital porous carbonaceous material is designed and synthesized through epitaxial growth method and used as anodes for LIBs and SIBs. It delivers high reversible capacity, super rate performance, and long cycling stability (473 mA h g-1after 500 cycles for LIBs and 223 mA h g-1 after 1200 cycles for SIBs, respectively, at the current density of 1000 mA g-1), with a capacity decay of 0.0214% per cycle for LIBs and 0.0155% per cycle for SIBs. The results demonstrate that constructing 3D interdigital porous structure with reactive oxygen functional groups can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of oxygen-doped carbonaceous material. 3D interdigital organic carbonaceous material with reactive oxygen functional groups exhibits excellent performance for both lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs).

In this research, two novel blue fluorescent materials with asymmetric structure: 2-(4\u2032-((4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)sulfonyl)-[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4-yl)-1-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole (PSC) and 2-(4\u2032-((4\u2032-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4-yl)sulfonyl)-[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-4-yl)-1-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole (PSBC), consisting of a sulfone group as the electron acceptor and two different electron donors, carbazole and phenanthroimidazole, were designed and synthesized. The two compounds have high \u03a6f (95.3% for PSC and 81.1% for PSBC) in film because of the restricting \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, and show apparent mechanochromic properties, i.e., an emission change from deep blue to blue-green resulting from external mechanical stimuli. The emissions display 50 nm/23 nm red shifts after grinding.

These can be obtained by \u03b4 doping with Mn the GaAs layers of a GaAs/AlAs superlattice. Our analysis spans a range of Mn concentrations and considers the presence of compensating defects such as As antisites. In the defect-free case all the heterostructures studied present a half-metallic electronic structure. In contrast, when As antisites are present the half-metallic state is destroyed and the heterostructures behave as dirty planar metals. In this case they show a large p-type metallic conductance in the Mn plane mainly due to majority spin electrons, and an n-type hopping like conductance in the GaAs planes mainly due to minority spin electrons.

For comparison, ultrafast chemical deposition of Fe hydroxides on NiVS/NF (uFe/NiVS/NF) is also utilized. V-doping of NiVS/NF may introduce more active sites for OER, and nanowire structure can expose abundant active sites and facilitate mass transport.

It is found that after being ball milled with 1 mol % of NbF5, AlH3 in the composite has almost fully decomposed and forms metallic Al, which indicates that NbF 5 can significantly destabilize AlH3. DSC results show that NbF5 addition also helps reduce the peak desorption temperature of MgH2 in the composite from 324 to 280 \u00b0C. Isothermal desorption measurements demonstrate that MgH2 in the doped composite can rapidly release 98% of its hydrogen after desorption at 300 \u00b0C for 1 h, while the valued is only 46% for the undoped composite. The activation energy for hydrogen desorption of MgH2 in the doped composite is calculated to be 104.5 kJ/mol, much lower than that in the undoped composite (127.4 kJ/mol). These results suggest that NbF5 addition dramatically improves the hydrogen desorption kinetics of the MgH2 + 1/4AlH 3 composite. Dehydrogenation-hydrogenation measurements reveal that the hydrogen desorption kinetics of the undoped composite declines with cycle number, whereas the NbF5-doped composite maintains good cycling stability.

This paper reviews the recent progress in germanium (Ge) spintronics on the basis of the electrical spin injection from ferromagnets (FM), where Ge is a next generation semiconductor for applications such as CMOS and optical communication on the silicon platform. In general, four-terminal nonlocal voltage measurements in FM-Ge lateral spin-valve devices are important to discuss the spin transport and spin relaxation in n-Ge. First, to obtain relatively low contact resistance compared to the FM/MgO/Ge contacts, we introduce the formation of high-quality FM/Ge heterointerfaces with a phosphorus \u03b4-doped Ge layer, where the atomic arrangement matching at the interface between the (1 1 1) surface of body-centered cubic FMs and Ge(1 1 1) is important. Next, we explain electrical detections of the spin transport in degenerate n-Ge. Owing to the Heusler alloy/Ge Schottky-tunnel barrier contacts, we obtain relatively large spin signals compared to those detected by using conventional CoFe contacts. Furthermore, we can experimentally determine the spin diffusion length and the spin lifetime in degenerate n-Ge by quantitatively analyzing the contact-distance dependence of the spin signals and the Hanle-effect curves. Since we can clarify the temperature dependence of the spin lifetime from 8 to 296 K, the spin relaxation mechanism in n-Ge can be understood as a consequence of the intervalley spin-flip scattering in the conduction band. We propose an advantage over GaAs systems by comparing the spin lifetimes between Ge and GaAs at around room temperature.
