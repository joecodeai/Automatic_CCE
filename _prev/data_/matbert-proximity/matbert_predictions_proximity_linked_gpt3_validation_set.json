[{"doi": "10.1007/s10853-017-1104-8", "text": "A comparative study is presented on chemical bath-deposited ZnO films, doped with the group-13 metals Al, Ga and In. The study reveals marked differences in dopant incorporation in the films, which increases in the order: In, Al and Ga. The presence of dopant in the solution induces significant modifications in the deposition rate, which varies between 110 and 40\u00a0nm\u00a0min\u22121. All films are (002)-textured, whereas the lattice stress evolution with the dopant type and concentration suggests that Ga has the highest degree of substitutional incorporation in Zn sites. The average visible transmittance is higher than 80%, while the infrared reflectivity depends on the free carrier density in the films, which is the lowest for undoped ZnO and increases in the order: In-, Al- and Ga-doped ZnO. Optical measurements also yield an inverse correlation between carrier density and mobility. Doping enlarges the bandgap, as well as the Urbach energy that is related to the films\u2019 disorder. The lowest electrical resistivity, measured by four-point probe, is 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm and is obtained for In-doped films after being exposed to ultraviolet light.

Molecular doping has been proven as an effective way for graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) to extend its light harvesting and improve its charge separation and transport, while little attention has been paid on its effect on the charge transfer at the interfaces between GCN and the cocatalyst. Herein, a pyrimidine-based molecule, 2,4-diaminopyrimidine (DAP), was first used to combine with urea for preparing doped GCN. It is found that the optimal doped GCN sample, CN-DAP 36 , has a narrowed band gap, reduced photoluminescent emission, and longer carrier lifetime, as compared with the undoped GCN. The hydrogen evolution rate of the doped GCN is found to be 2.80 mmol/(h\u00b7g), 6.09 times that of the undoped GCN [0.46 mmol/(h\u00b7g)] under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, according to theoretical calculations, the pyrimidine groups in DAP possess a stronger adsorption capacity for Pt particles than the tri-s-triazine of GCN does, thus leading to more Pt particles deposited near the pyrimidine rings.

The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction. The width of the observed peak in photocurrent is found to be highly asymmetric with respect to the p or n side of the junction. The reason for this asymmetry is discussed in terms of diffusion length of minority carriers in the n- and p-GaAs close to the suface. \u00a9 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
