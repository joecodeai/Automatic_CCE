The fabrication process has been designed to allow the integration of such infrared emitters with an array of thermopile infrared detectors, with the aim of achieving an integrated non-dispersive infrared microspectrometer. A first set of infrared emitters with a common size for the doped silicon radiating slab (1,100 \u00d7 300 \u00d7 8 \u03bcm3) has been successfully fabricated and characterized. The working temperature of the Jouleheated radiating slabs has been controlled by means of DC and pulsed electrical signals, achieving temperatures well beyond 700\u00b0C. The thermal time constant measured in pulsed operation, around 50 ms, is adequate to enable the direct electrical modulation of the emitted radiation up to a frequency of 5 Hz while maintaining the full modulation depth.

All possible scattering events of hot electrons in the medium, the main details of the band structure, as well as the heating effects, are taken into account. The results presented in this study derive from numerical simulations of the electron dynamical response to the application of a sub-Thz electric field, fluctuating for the superimposition of an external source of Gaussian correlated noise. The electronic noise features are statistically investigated by computing the correlation function of the velocity fluctuations, its spectral density and the variance, i.e. the total noise power, for different values of amplitude and frequency of the driving field. Our results show the presence of a cooperative non-linear behavior of electrons, whose dynamics is strongly affected by the field fluctuations. Moreover, the electrons self-organize among different valleys, giving rise to the reduction of the intrinsic noise. This counterintuitive effect critically depends on the relationship among the characteristic times of the external fluctuations and the temporal scales of complex phenomena involved in the electron dynamical response.

Under these conditions, the well-known instability of this material against carbon dioxide and humidity can be minimized, potentially allowing its application even in hydrocarbon-based atmospheres. Nonetheless, electrochemical transport properties of grain boundaries of BCY are still not well understood. Hence, we compare specific grain boundary conductivity and space-charge properties of BaCe0\u00b79Y0\u00b71O3-\u03b4 (BCY10) in both wet and low humidity by means of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 100\u2013300 \u00b0C. In H2, specific grain boundary conductivity increases in nominally dry conditions, while the bulk remains practically humidity independent. Conversely, in O2, both bulk and specific grain boundary conductivities are higher in wet. The space-charge properties highlight that low levels of humidity, pH2O ~10\u22124 atm, are sufficient to maintain functional performance, while providing enough stability.

Herein, a pyrimidine-based molecule, 2,4-diaminopyrimidine (DAP), was first used to combine with urea for preparing doped GCN. It is found that the optimal doped GCN sample, CN-DAP 36 , has a narrowed band gap, reduced photoluminescent emission, and longer carrier lifetime, as compared with the undoped GCN. The hydrogen evolution rate of the doped GCN is found to be 2.80 mmol/(h\u00b7g), 6.09 times that of the undoped GCN [0.46 mmol/(h\u00b7g)] under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, according to theoretical calculations, the pyrimidine groups in DAP possess a stronger adsorption capacity for Pt particles than the tri-s-triazine of GCN does, thus leading to more Pt particles deposited near the pyrimidine rings. The extension in optical absorption, the reduction in charge recombination, and the enhancement in charge transport, along with the facilitation in the interfacial charge transfer from the doped GCN

dosing induced electronic structure change", "text": "Alkali metal dosing (AMD) has been widely used as a way to control doping without chemical substitution. This technique, in combination with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), often provides an opportunity to observe unexpected phenomena. However, the amount of transferred charge and the corresponding change in the electronic structure vary significantly depending on the material. Here, we report study on the correlation between the sample work function and alkali metal induced electronic structure change for three iron-based superconductors: FeSe, Ba(Fe0.94Co0.06)2As2 and NaFeAs which share a similar Fermi surface topology. Electronic structure change upon monolayer of alkali metal dosing and the sample work function were measured by ARPES. Our results show that the degree of electronic structure change is proportional to the difference between the work function of the sample and Mulliken's absolute electronegativity of the dosed alkali metal.

The active region of this detector is defined by the pn-interface region of a highly doped GaAs homojunction. The cleavage plane normal to the interface defines a line detector with high spatial resolution. The actual resolution was tested using a near-field scanning optical microscope. An Al-coated tapered optical fiber of nominal aperture of 60 nm was scanned in the optical near-field vicinity across the active region of the junction. The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction. The width of the observed peak in photocurrent is found to be highly asymmetric with respect to the p or n side of the junction. The reason for this asymmetry is discussed in terms of diffusion length of minority carriers in the n- and p-GaAs close to the suface. \u00a9 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
