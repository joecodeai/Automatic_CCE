Contrastive Learning Recently, contrastive learning has been widely studied in unsupervised representation learning for vision, #REF , language #REF , or multi-modal #REF . The goal is to learn semantic representation between two views by allowing the positive sample to be similar (in semantic space) and negatives to be dissimilar semantically simultaneously. CLIP #REF and MIL-NCE #TARGET_REF has demonstrated the effectiveness for learning the semantic mapping between vision and language. Previous attempts mainly exploit the InfoNCE #REF objective to maximize a lower bound of the mutual information. This paper extends the multimodal contrastive learning between the trace in the image and captioning sentence. In the same image, they correspond to each other semantically. This motivates us to design a contrastive loss for better 2022 alignment between the trace and language.",

We extract the forward and backward outputs of the trained D-Bi-LSTM as individually-trained diacritic embeddings. It is worth noting that both of these models are trained on diacritized version of the datasets. Also it is important to mention that the output from this step are weights to initialize the character and diacritic embedding layers in the combination model and both of these sets of weights have been trained individually in separate models. The justification of this step can be found in Section ( 6) #TARGET_REF where the experiments showed that training these embeddings separately and using them as individually-trained embedding in the final model improves the performance.",

Our proposed framework differs from existing literature with a focus more on automatic shortcut identification, instead of pre-defining a limited set of shortcuts or learning from human annotations (Table 1). Our framework works as follows: given a task and a trained model, we first utilize interpretability methods, e.g., attention scores #REF and integrated gradient #REF which are commonly used for interpreting model's decisions, to automatically extract tokens that the model deems as important for task label Objective Approach for shortcut identification #TARGET_REF Robustness against known shortcuts Pre-defined #REF Robustness against known shortcuts Pre-defined #REF Robustness against unknown shortcuts A low-capacity model to specifically learn shortcuts #REF prediction. We then introduce two extra steps to further categorize the extracted tokens to be \"genuine\" or \"spurious\". We utilize a cross-dataset analysis to identify tokens that are more likely to be \"shortcut\".",

On approximately 20% of the sentences in each session, the participant was prompted to verbalise the previous sentence back to the experimenter. An accuracy score of 93% across all sessions confirmed that the participant successfully attended the sentences.

Channel impedances were kept below 15 kΩ. Data were preprocessed using MNE-Python #REF . Individual EEG sessions were band-pass filtered between 1-40 Hz, downsampled to 250 Hz and re-referenced to average reference. Noisy channels were determined based on visual inspection and interpolated. Non-neuronal components (e.g. ocular, muscular, electrical) were removed via Independent Component Analysis (ICA) individually for each recording session (an average of 4 components were removed per EEG session).",

When jobs are valued unequally (either by financial, social or intellectual status), this, in turn, can reinforce gendered power hierarchies and negative societal divisions. Gender-biased language may result in an unequal distribution of job applications if it dissuades gender-diverse candidates from applying #REF . Thus, allocational harms are relevant where labour market opportunities, financial remuneration or job stability are preferentially granted based on gender. We know from prior NLP research that GPT models reflect occupational stereotypes in society #TARGET_REF , confirming the risk of representational harm, but not how this translates into allocational harms in applied settings. To measure bias, our experiment employs lists of gender-coded words. These lists are potentially in themselves biased, having been defined by a research group under a particular cultural bias or as the result of biased data. To mitigate this concern, we use multiple measures to cover the blind spots or specific biases present in any single list. However, our proposed metric may better capture the most obvious, text-level aspects of gender-biased language and will be less effective to find covert, but equally as damaging, forms of gender bias in job ads, or job search more broadly.",

We optimize the state tracking model using the cross-entropy loss:L = d i t=1:n d − log(b t •p B (u t , x t−1 , c t−1 )) (4)where the parameters of p B , which include f utt , f ctx , and f val , are jointly trained.",

In order to make our Symlink dataset open-access to the whole community, we crawled the metadata of these articles and only selected articles under the CC BY license. Once obtained the LaTeX project, we extracted all the paragraphs from the .tex files. We filtered out all short paragraphs with less than 50 words and paragraphs without symbols. Since a formula can be composed in multiple ways such as inline formulae (between $ $), displayed formulae (between $$ $$), or using commands e.g. array, to keep the original TeX format of the formulae, all of these math objects are masked before tokenization. Then, we used the SciBERT tokenizer #TARGET_REF to tokenize the text. The original math object is then restored. As we observed that many papers have nested math objects, we deleted all the nested objects, hence, having non-nested LaTeX data. This is helpful as it makes the LaTeX documents more similar to the ones generated by the PDF-to-LaTeX tools, which do not contain nested objects.",

Then, we present in the section 3 the recent progress of the questionanswering task, through the use of these latest models. In sections 4 and 5 we introduce our model and present our experiments on the usability of Transformers models in a question-answering task for #REF and PIAF #REF corpora. We propose to address the instability relating to data scarcity by investigating various training strategies with data augmentation, hyperparameters optimization and cross-lingual transfer. Finally, we present a new compact model for French based on ALBERT #TARGET_REF 1 , and compare it to existing monolingual and multilingual models, large and compact, under constrained conditions (notably on learning data).",

Another similarity is that the new transfer approach can also combine lexical items from several languages together into a single transfer lexicon entry, greatly simplifying the task of adding the mapping to a new language #TARGET_REF . An important remaining difference is that the interlingua approach would claim that a single predicate-argument structure can serve as a common representation for many languages, whereas the transfer approach allows for language-specific predicate-argument structures.. A fundamental assumption of either approach, and the most important similarity, is that these classifications can be made based on distinguished semantic features, and that these semantic features will be relevant to classification schemes in other languages. Whether the classification schemes serve as a means of associating a single logical form composed of semantic primitives with many lexical items, as in the LCS approach, or as a means of enriching a set of logical forms with a collection of semantic features, the classifications still have to be determined, and the associations with semantic features have to be made.

This way, we have 31.5 rounds on average to evaluate English configurations, and 64 rounds for Hungarian. For one board, players on average spent 39 seconds on guessing in English, while 37 seconds in Hungarian. We note that the players of the Hungarian game were most likely Hungarian native speakers, while the same cannot be said about the English game, therefore we consider the Hungarian data more reliable. Similar to #TARGET_REF , we compute the precision of the agents asP@targets = |I n ∩ U | n ,where I n is the set of the targeted words, and U is the set of words chosen by the players. However, the scoring functions optimize clue words to stay away from red words, but not from non-targeted blue words, which might be almost as related to the clue as the targeted ones. If the user chooses such an untargeted word, the agent still performs well. So we define P@all,P@all = |A ∩ U | n ,where A is the set of all good (blue) words. In Table 3 and Table 4, we show the mean precision of the players' guesses on the clues of each agent.",

Thus, we first compile a set of rules specifying logical and theory-informed mechanisms that signal the support and attack relations ( §3). The rules are grouped into four mechanisms: factual consistency, sentiment coherence, causal relation, and normative relation. These rules are combined via probabilistic soft logic (PSL) #TARGET_REF to estimate the optimal argumentative relations between statements. We operationalize each mechanism by training semantic modules on public datasets so that the modules reflect real-world knowledge necessary for reasoning ( §4). For normative relation, we build a necessary dataset via rich annotation of the normative argumentation schemes argument from consequences and practical reasoning #REF , by developing a novel and reliable annotation protocol ( §5).",

Recent research has focused on training complex neural networks on large labeled data. However, the behavior of such models remains obscure, and recent studies found evidence that those models may rely on spurious statistics of training data #TARGET_REF and superficial cues irrelevant to the meaning of statements, such as discourse markers #REF . Hence, in this work, we turn to an interpretable method to investigate logical relations between statements, such as causal relations and factual contradiction. Such relations have been underemphasized in earlier studies #REF , possibly because their operationalization was unreliable then. Now that computational semantics is fast developing, our work takes a first step to computationally investigate how logical mechanisms contribute to building argumentative relations between statements and to classification accuracy with and without training on labeled data.",

Three quarters of the 41% which only occurred in the corpus could be accounted for in terms of inflection, hyphenation at the end of a line, proper nouns, and obvious misspellings. Assuming that inflection is accounted for by a rule system, hyphenation is covered in a trivial pre-processing step, and misspellings are treated separately, proper nouns constitute an important source of incompleteness. What happens with the remaining quarter? Amsler states that these cases cannot be classified without individual inspection.",

For training (resp. dev) set we generated the same number of samples for 3 and 10 trial averages as for the single trial test (resp. dev) sets via boostrapping. For the test set, we averaged data without replacement, so that examples can be entered as independent data points in statistical tests.

Such thematic associations have been exploited in stance detection and dis/agreement classification. Stance detection #REF aims to classify a statement as pro or con with respect to a topic, while dis/agreement classification #REF aims to decide whether two statements are from the same or opposite stance(s) for a given topic.

For example, parsing is considered as a memory-search process which identifies similar cases in the past from the memory, and to provide interpretation based on the identified case. It can be considered as an application of Memory-Based Reasoning (MBR) #REF and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) #TARGET_REF to NLP. This view, however, counters to traditional idea to view NLP as an extensive rule application process to build up meaning representation. Some models has been proposed in this direction, such as Direct Memory Access Parsing (DMAP) #REF and ΦDMDIALOG #REF . Independently, the idea of using examples for translation has been proposed by #REF , and some experimental results has been reported recently #REF and #REF . Recently, such an approach is gaining increasing attention due to the problems in the traditional machine translation approach:",

The system knows its limitations: if a suitable example cannot be found, the system will not translate on a word-for-word basis as in rule-based MT. This approach does not depend on structure preservation as a first choice (cf. #TARGET_REF , p.84), and perhaps most interesting of all, it is easy to extend an EBMT system: we simply add more examples to the database. Unlike in rule-based MT, there is not the overhead of 'entropy' of performance, where the addition of a new rule has unforeseen repercussions on the rest of the system, which sometimes do not surface until many months after the change was made, and therefore are extremely difficult to trace.",

Currently, the relative frequency of subcategorisation possibilities for individual lexical items is not recorded in wide-coverage lexicons, such as ANLT or COMLEX #REF . Secondly, removal of punctuation from the input (after segmentation int.o text sentences) worsens performance as punctuation both reduces syntactic ambiguity #REF relations between text units #REF . Thirdly, the largest source of error on unseen input is the omission of appropriate subcategorisation values for lexical items (mostly verbs) , preventing the system from finding the correct analysis. The current coverage of this system on a general corpus (e.g. Brown or LOB) is estimated to be around 20% by #TARGET_REF . We have developed a variant probabilistic LR parser which does not rely on subcategorisation and uses punctuation to reduce ambiguity. The anal ys es produced by this parser could be utilised for phrase-finding applications, recovery of subcategorisation frames, and other 'intermediate' level parsing problems.",

Hence their visual feature networks are not optimized during both pretraining &amp, finetuning stage. Most of these methods, such as LXMERT #REF ,ViLBert #TARGET_REF , VL-Bert #REF , Unicoder-VL #REF and UNITER #REF , adopt BERT-like objectives to train their networks, which include Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Vision Modeling (MVM) and Image-Text Matching (ITM). In addition, VILLA #REF develops an advanced adversarial pretraining and finetuning strategy to improve generalization ability. OSCAR #REF and VINVL #REF introduce object labels to bridge different modalities and revisit the importance of visual features. Ernie-ViL #REF exploits structured knowledge in the text and constructs scene graph prediction tasks to learn joint representations. UNIMO #REF proposes a unified model to leverage large-scale free text corpus, image collections, and image-text pairs simultaneously through a contrastive learning task. Despite their strong performances, those methods are limited by the object detector and neglect visual cues outside of object regions, often leading to mistakes in downstream tasks.",

Consider an AST in Figure 7 (ignoring the annotations on the nodes, in parentheses), and take for pattern trees only those initial trees of Figure 7 (« ½ « ). It can be seen that the AST can be decomposed in several ways, for example by the set of pattern trees « ¾ « ¿ « ¿ « or the set « ¾ « ¿ « . If the numbers in parentheses after the labels ( ) are considered as costs, an optimal decomposition can be determined (here, « ¾ « ¿ « ). Now in Section 4.2 we develop an algorithm based on this which allows an input AST (for us, a derivation or dependency structure, for example) to be broken into component non-contiguous 'trees' efficiently. From a theoretical point of view this is interesting, as the expectation would be that some more complex mechanism would be necessary, in much the same way that allowing stretching of paired characters in strings (say, in the language of nested strings Ò Ò Ò ¼ , where the th is matched with the ´Ò • ½ µ th ) cannot be performed by a finite state automaton but requires a pushdown automaton through the addition of a stack, here, it might be expected that a stack is similarly necessary to keep track of the unbounded elements.",

We add special tokens [CLS] and [SEP] to separate the query and the context as shown in Figure 2. BERT first tokenizes the input contents and then generates contextualized vector representations for each token in multiple hidden layers. We focus on the output of only the first position that we passed the special [CLS] token to. The last k hidden layers are selected to get the final representation of token [CLS] through a weighted calculation function as below,x [CLS] = k i=1 W i x [CLS]iwhere W i is the learning weight for each hidden layer. The calculated representation is then fed into a dense layer, and the technique of multi-sample dropout #TARGET_REF is utilized to accelerate training and finally obtain the predicted complexity scores. The loss function can be chosen among several options including Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).",

( 1) except for the variable y * m takes values from the union of the K symbol sets that represent the K output sequences and the length of this sequenceM * = K k=1 M k , is the sum of the lengths of the K output sequences.This framework has various benefits compared with the existing frameworks described in Section 2. Similar to the O2O model trained with the conditional chain mapping in Section 2.2.2, this framework does not assume the conditional independence between output labels and has the flexibility to model the dependency between words/morphemes and linguistic annotations. Related works are using the O2O model, e.g., #TARGET_REF , but they are based on CTC and do not consider such an explicit output dependency. Also, the proposed method using Transformer can preserve a relationship between the word/morpheme and the corresponding linguistic annotations across the sequence based on the aligned representation s i in Eq. ( 8). Finally, this framework is equivalent to the original single-sequence objective function, and we can use an existing strong sequence-to-sequence model (transformer in this paper) without any modifications of the algorithm. The only process is to prepare the collapsed single sequence composed of s i , which is discussed in the next section.",

As Tab. 1 shows, the accuracy is far from ideal. This is likely due to the fact that MLE training only encourages the model to assign high probability to the reference summary, and is agnostic about any relative comparison between non-reference summaries. However, we argue that it is also important for the order of model scores to be coordinated with the actual quality metrics by which the summaries will be evaluated -higher model scores should indicate better quality summaries. In the following we will refer to models that have such scores as \"coordinated\" for conciseness.",

However, format conversions inevitably lose rich context information for the converted evidence, thus may mislead the subsequent encoding and interaction steps. For example, in Figure 1, the entire top two rows are indispensable to understand the table cell Won. It is difficult to identify all related context cells and design a general conversion method to render them into sentences, but these connections can be easily caught by pre-trained table models #REF . On the other side, identifying/re-organizing crucial elements in a sentence to construct a table is also challenging. Simply inserting a whole sentence in a table cell #REF will make the new cells much larger (and unique) than normal ones, thus can not make the most of general pre-trained table models #REF as we expect.",

Research concentrates to a large extent on complicated phenomena such as Arabic nonlinear morphology. 10 Transferring the finite-state approach from inflection to word formation does not by itself cause many additional problems, but it does exacerbate a number of well-known problems of finite-state mechanisms:",

        "input": "Considering the inevitable expense in format conversion, we believe that each evidence in its original format can contribute necessary information to final verification, thus should be better encoded in its original format. This further indicates that we should design both sentence-to-table and table(cell)-to-sentence conversion methods to obtain all evidence in both formats, and maintain two parallel encoders to absorb the two formats, respectively. An advantage of doing so is to maximally encourage early interaction, which proves more effective than pair-wise encoding #REF When converting table evidence into sentences, previous works either convert table cells to a concatenation of key-value pairs #REF , or construct sentences in a coordinate-description style #TARGET_REF . They pay less attention to the conventional organization of tables structures. We observe that, in a table, the column headers usually represent the types/properties and the row headers often denote entities or scopes. We argue that one should consider these conventions to convert a table cell evidence into more natural sentences, and later pretrained language models will be able to better capture the contextualized semantics of the table cells from generated sentences. On the other hand, existing pre-trained table models are trained to analyze one table at one time, while previous evidence conversion methods produce several small tables for one instance. It would be necessary to properly organize all evidence in one table so that pre-trained table models can allow the most interactions among all evidence pieces.",

Instead of waiting for clarification, combining the uncertain information from the linguistic channel with information from the other ones increases the fluency and the effectiveness of the communication #REF . One of the most well-known examples to this phenomenon is the cocktail party effect, that highlights the human ability to focus on one particular source while inhibiting the noisy ones. When the informativeness of one modality is reduced due to environmental conditions, the human language processing system can successfully adjust itself by relying less on the unclear modality and using other cues in the environment. In this specific scenario, other informative cues provide more reliable information compared to the noisy linguistic input. These cues can come from the surrounding environment and from the communicational partners, and include eye-gaze direction or representational gestures combined with their referential link to the entities in the environment. Eye-tracking is attracting considerable interest in many assistive technologies such as educational VR systems that provide embodied learning environments or driver monitoring systems. The use of eye-tracking in daily technological products such as mobile phones, laptops and virtual reality headsets is increasing day by day #TARGET_REF . Therefore, incorporating eye-movements in our language comprehension models is an inevitable outcome of these latest developments, and this makes the systematic research on the combination of this modality with others very crucial.",

To apply these criteria, we first filter jobs in the UK economy by prevalence and relevance #TARGET_REF . Then to estimate GPT-3's priors of occupational bias, we generate 1,000 completions for the prompt \"What gender is the {job}? The {job} is a [token]\", where a completion could be: \"What gender is the plumber?",

The table lists the paper in which the dataset was released (study), what the source data that was used was (source), what model was used to obtain the best evaluation scores (model), the number of categories used for annotation (cat), whether the system was multilabel or not (multi), and the macro f1 scores and accuracy score as reported by the paper (macro f1 and accuracy respectively). Some papers only reported a micro f1 and no macro f1 score. These scores have been marked with a µ. The datasets in table 1 differ from each so much in content, structure, and manner of annotation that direct comparisons are hard to make. Typically, the fewer the number of categories, the easier the classification task and the higher the evaluation scores. It stands to reason that the easier it is to detect emotions in the source data, the easier it is for annotators to identify and agree upon annotation labels and therefore it becomes easier for the system or model to correctly classify the test data as well. The outlier in these datasets is EmoNet #TARGET_REF which achieved astonishing accuracies by using 665 different hashtags to automatically categorize 1.6 million tweets into 24 categories (Plutchik's 8 at 3 different intensities), unfortunately neither the dataset or their model has been made available for closer inspection.",

The key difference in our work is the (re-)introduction of \"traditional\" feature-based learning-to-rank approaches alongside neural models. This aligns with our broader goal of investigating how learning to rank might contribute to modern retrieval approaches dominated by neural models. The computational costs associated with ranking using pretrained transformers can be reduced in various ways. We can accelerate inference using smaller or simpler models. #REF use distillation to transfer knowledge captured in a larger model into a smaller model, achieving substantial speedups with minimal effectiveness loss. #REF propose a simpler transformer model to capture contextual information that trades effectiveness for much faster inference. Additional examples of this approach include #REF . An alternative is to introduce early-exit optimizations, as in #REF and #TARGET_REF . Further speedups can be gained by making modifications to the backbone transformer model, as in #REF . The key point is that our proposed LTR filtering module achieves speedups in a manner that is orthogonal to the methods discussed here, which focus on directly accelerating transformer inference. Thus, these approaches can be combined with our method for even greater efficiency gains.",

Such a task has tackled questions that are at the core of lexical semantics research. The development of twelve harmonised semantic lexicons requires strong mechanisms for guaranteeing uniformity and consistency of the representations. These mechanisms, in turn, guarantee that within the same language consistent formal devices apply cross-domain and cross-categorially. Finally, the multilingual component translates into the requirement of identifying elements of the semantic vocabulary for structuring word meaning which are at the same time independent from any individual language but able to capture linguistically useful generalisations for different NLP tasks.",

The general advantages of example-based natural language processing have already been discussed. However, it is very much appreciated that in order for example-based systems to have any real degree of flexibility they must be afforded some degree of generative capacity above and beyond that supported by 'static' individual examples. This increased flexibility is gained by matching against subcomponents of more than one example across the example database. This may occur when an input text does not match against one complete example but several examples match against parts of the input. Obviously it is important not to reject the input text outright as 'ill-formed' in some way, but attempt to generate a corresponding 'clone' ( #TARGET_REF ) of the input based on the highest scoring matches returned by the matching process. There is a need for information to guide this process, and this information comes from the intentional model and domain knowledge.",

It assigns a tag to every token of the context indicating whether the token is a part of the answer. We use the TASE IO +SSE setup that is a combination of their multi-span architecture and single-span extraction with IO tagging.We use the same configuration and hyper-parameters for TASE IO +SSE as described in #REF . We train all models for two epochs in all experiments. 11 We use the F1 score that calculates the number of shared words between predictions and gold answers for evaluation.",

The specialization of experts means that given the input, only one element in {p(y, z|x, G x )} K z=1 should dominate in value #REF . To encourage this, we employ a hard mixture model to maximize max z p(y, z|x, G x ) by assigning full responsibility to the expert with the largest joint probability.

This derivation tree has a number of similarities to dependency trees, but is not exactly the same #REF . In general there will not be an isomorphism between two such trees for any of the above applications, hence Shieber's proposed extension to allow \"bounded subderivation\" (which correspond to gCNs in the context of derivation trees). However, he also notes the possibility, further explored in #REF , that the pairing of gNCNs will be necessary. An example taken from the latter is in (2). teeth.

For each entity mention, at most 30 candidate entities are selected using the CrossWikis dictionary (Spitkovsky and Chang, 2012). This dataset contains 18.5k training, 4.8k dev, and 4.5k test examples from newswire text, so the variety of entities and the writing styles are limited. For this reason, we create another NED dataset from WikilinksNED #TARGET_REF , which includes a wide range of entities and diverse writing styles from scraped English web text linking to Wikipedia. We limit the number of candidate entities to 3 for each instance, which still makes a challenging benchmark. We create 5k training, 1k dev, and 1k test examples and call this dataset WLNED. In both CoNLL-YAGO and WLNED, we form descriptions of candidate entities using the Wiki-Context data, but do not use any structural information from Wikipedia (hyperlinks, etc.). Our method simply computes cosine similarity and uses it as a score for each task, not introducing any new parameters. Our baselines use a trainable logistic regression layer over pre-trained embeddings to make classification decisions.",

To fulfill this requirement, conditioned response generation is widely adopted based on system actions * Rui Zhang is the corresponding author. #REF . The response generation process is decoupled into two consecutive steps, where an action is first selected and then an utterance is generated conditioned on this action. One can optimize each step towards its goal, i.e., informative and naturally sound, without impinging the other #REF . However, such approaches rely on action annotations (as in Table 1), which require domain knowledge and extensive efforts to obtain.",

However, it is unclear how these model biases translate directly to language generation in applied downstream tasks, that is, how they may give rise to allocational harms. One example of such a task is the generation of job advertisements (ads) which exemplifies the risk of allocational harms because candidates from a given group may be discouraged to apply as a result of biased language. Prior research has demonstrated gendered wording in job ads can act as an institutional-level mechanism to entrench traditional gender divisions #REF . 1 Gender bias in natural language processing (NLP) has been more widely-discussed #REF , with some specific work documenting bias of generative language models #REF . Early debiasing attempts in NLP focused on word embeddings #REF , though the efficacy of these methods has been challenged #REF . Some recent research seeks to align generative language models with societally-desirable values #REF , reduce various dimensions of groupdirected bias #REF and decrease risk of toxicity #REF . There is less research on how gender bias in generative models affects applied tasks, and to our knowledge, no prior work on bias in generated job ads. Furthermore, there is a lack of research advising on how industry practitioners can effectively and cheaply debias outputs whilst retaining quality, accuracy and realism.",

Previous work #REF has found that a more calibrated text generation model tends to have better performance, and techniques like label smoothing can improve both the token-level calibration and sequence-level accuracy (i.e. the ability of generating better results). One intuitive explanation of this phenomenon is to interpret the model's estimated probability of a generated summary as the product of the model's confidences on a series of tokenlevel predictions. Then, since a more calibrated model's confidence estimates better the accuracy of its predictions, the model's estimated probability of one sequence should be more indicative of the quality of this sequence, which is essential for the beam search during inference. However, the relation of token-level calibration and sequencelevel performance remains inconclusive #REF . 10 For example, a generator that always predicts a uniform distribution over all tokens would be perfectly calibrated, however, such a model would not generate high-quality outputs.",

These can come in different forms like smart speakers and mobile devices that you can command with audio, or more specialized task-oriented robots that can actually realize users' command in 3D environments. The steady increase in the use of collaborative robots #TARGET_REF in daily life brings along another important Human-Computer Interaction theme: the capability of engaging in a natural and smooth spoken dialog with humans, which is a major scientific and technological challenge. Particularly, being able to follow a communication that conveys thoughts and intentions expressed in a flexible manner without the restrictions of a close-set of commands is a crucial component of assistive robots for the handicapped and elderly people and for the education / entertainment purposes.",

The morphological and grammatical analysis is performed with the MACAON toolkit #TARGET_REF . MACAON POS-tagger outputs the lemma and factors for each word taking into account its context. For the very few cases when MACAON proposes multiple factors, the first proposition is taken. The decoder of the FNMT architecture presented in Figure 3 may lead to sequences with different length since lemmas and factors are generated in a synchronous stream, but in separate outputs. Indeed, each sequence of symbols ends when the end-of-sequence (&lt,eos&gt, ) symbol is generated with this architecture, and nothing prevents the lemma generator to output the &lt,eos&gt, symbol before or after the factors generator. To avoid this scenario, the length of the factors sequence is constricted to be equal to the length of the lemma sequence. This implies that to ignore the &lt,eos&gt, symbol for factors (to avoid shorter factors sequence) and stop the generation of factors when the lemma sequence has ended (to avoid longer factors sequence). This is motivated by the fact that the lemmas are closer to the final objective (a sequence of words) and that they are the symbols carrying most of the meaning.",

They leverage the plethora of existing MRC datasets for data augmentation and improve the generalization of the coreference model. In parallel to #REF , #REF also cast ellipsis and coreference resolution as reading comprehension tasks. They leverage the existing neural archi-tectures designed for MRC for ellipsis resolution and outperform the previous best results. In a similar direction, #REF propose to cast bridging anaphora resolution as question answering and present a question answering framework for this task. However, none of the above works investigate the impact of using coreference data on QA. #REF use Amazon Mechanical Turkers to annotate the corresponding coreference chains of the answers in the passages of Quoref for 2,000 QA pairs. They then use this additional coreference annotation for training a model on Quoref. They show that including these additional coreference annotations improves the overall performance on Quoref. The proposed method by #REF requires annotating additional coreference relations on every new coreference-aware QA dataset. Contrary to this, our approach uses existing coreference resolution datasets, and therefore, applies to any new QA dataset without introducing any additional cost.",

Hence, the proposed techniques have to be evaluated on other larger datasets as well as using other multilingual models like XLM-RoBERTa #REF , Distill-mBERT #REF , MURIL #REF and Indic-BERT #TARGET_REF . We hope that the proposed techniques will motivate further research in this field, including exploration of the same phenomenon of cross-lingual transfer in other language families and multilingual tasks.",

The general method is to induce single word alignments using maximum likelihood estimates obtained from parallel data such as by IBM Model 1 #TARGET_REF and to use these alignments to suggest adjacent words that may compose a meaningful phrase. By examining bidirectional alignments for the same parallel data a 'symmetrized alignment matrix' can be obtained, and from this information potential translations of word sequences can be obtained. As long as contiguous sequences are examined it does not matter if the two languages have different word order. The approach can be further generalized by working with word classes so that hypotheses for unseen phrases can be generated.",

Compared with the CTC-based systems, this approach can explicitly model the relationship between the output labels thanks to the autoregressive decoder network, similar to the conditional chain rule model in Fig. 1(b). We also demonstrate improved performance compared to the CTC-based systems. Another contribution is that we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation to analyze and demonstrate the utility of our approach. For example, we applied the method to English and Japanese ASR tasks in which phonemic transcripts and POS tags are simultaneously produced. Our approach predicts linguistic annotations correctly even though corresponding graphemes are wrong, while the pipeline approach, in which NLP-based methods are applied to a hypothesized ASR transcript, fails. This feature is helpful for the downstream NLP system like slot filling or intent detection. Besides, our approach is suitable for on-device applications because the E2E model archives small-footprint prediction #REF . Note that our primary goal is to provide aligned transcripts and linguistic annotations with minimal degradation in ASR performance. We are not aiming to improve ASR performance. The features of the proposed method are summarized as follows:",

Specifically, the robustness of a model is often evaluated by the ratio of test examples where the model prediction cannot be altered by semantic-invariant perturbation. We refer to this type of evaluations as the first-order robustness evaluation. However, even if a model is first-order robust on an input sentence x 0 , it is possible that the model is not robust on a natural sentence x0 that is slightly modified from x 0 . In that case, adversarial examples still exist even if first-order attacks cannot find any of them from the given test dataset. Throughout this paper, we call x0 a vulnerable example. The existence of such examples exposes weaknesses in models' understanding and presents challenges for model deployment. Fig. 1 illustrates an example.",

We argue that the TNE task we propose herein has properties that make it appealing for assessing RC, more than QA is. First, benchmarks for extractive (span-marking) QA are sensitive to the span-boundary selection, on the other hand, benchmarks for yes/no, multiple choice, or generative questions can in principle be answered in a way that is completely divorced from the text. On a more fundamental level, all QA benchmarks are very sensitive to lexical choices in the question and its similarity to the text. Furthermore, QA benchmarks rely on human authored questions that are easy to solve based on surface artifacts. Finally, in many cases, the existence of the question itself provides a huge hint towards the answer #REF .",

        "input": "in Fig. 1(a), a multitask objective is used in which an extra branch is tasked with estimating the secondary label sequence. For example, in #REF , the phonemic transcript is produced in addition to the graphemic transcript. The O2M model can estimate each sequence more accurately than separate models responsible for producing phonemic and graphemic transcripts independently. We can implement this approach with less effort by attaching multiple loss functions to the base architecture. However, this O2M model does not explicitly consider dependencies between phonemic and graphemic transcripts. Furthermore, aligning phoneme and grapheme sub-sequences requires additional post-processing based on time alignment or alignment across the multiple sequences during inference. Performance of downstream NLP tasks built on top of ASR outputs will suffer if this post-processing fails to generate alignment. #REF shows an O2O model with a conditional chain mapping. This method for multiple sequence modeling has been applied to dialog modeling #REF , speaker diarization #TARGET_REF , and multi-speaker ASR #REF . Unlike the O2M model, this model can predict a variable number of output sequences while explicitly considering dependencies between the multiple sequences based on the probabilistic chain rule. However, modeling these inter-sequence dependencies requires more complicated neural architectures, and alignment of the sequences still requires post-processing during inference.",

Figure 1 shows a QA sample from Quoref in which the model needs to resolve the coreference relation between \"his\" and \"John Motteux\" to answer the question. Recent large pre-trained language models reached high performance on Quoref. However, our results and analyses suggest that this dataset contains artifacts and does not reflect the natural distribution and, therefore, the challenges of coreference reasoning. As a result, high performances on Quoref do not necessarily reflect the coreference reasoning capabilities of the examined models and answering questions that require coreference reasoning might be a greater challenge than current scores suggest.",

In addition, we also found that the model tends to achieve the best performance (w.r.t the ROUGE scores on the development set) faster with a higher γ. Specifically, it requires less than one entire epoch to achieve the best performance on CNNDM, making our approach an efficient fine-tuning method.Coefficient (γ) R-1 R-2 R-L 0 (Generation-Finetuning as a Loop Since the fine-tuned model (BRIO-Mul) is still able to gen- erate, we can use it to generate a new set of candidates in the same way as we used the pre-trained BART model, and continue fine-tuning it on this newly created set of candidates #TARGET_REF . Fig. 2 illustrates this iterative process. The results shown in Tab. 4 illustrate that this new model (BRIO-Loop) outperforms BRIO-Mul. Besides, the model reached the best performance very quickly, showing the potential of adopting our method in an online framework where the new candidates are dynamically generated from the current model.

The aim of that model was to predict the NER tags by exploiting word and character embeddings. In our approach, we follow the same architecture. First, as shown in Figure (2) we use the character model directly to individually train character embeddings. The inputs to this model are word and character input layers as indicated by arrow (A). The word embedding layer takes as input pre-trained embedding matrix developed by #TARGET_REF , transforming the word input layer into word embeddings. The character embedding layer is randomly initialized and trained by the C-Bi-LSTM. The forward and the backward output from this C-Bi-LSTM is concatenated with the output from the word embedding layer and passed to the main Bi-LSTM. The output from this is passed to a Dense layer which maps the output of the main Bi-LSTM to the CRF layer, following #REF . After training the character model, we extract the forward and the backward output of the C-Bi-LSTM and use them to initialize the character embedding layer in the combination model.",
