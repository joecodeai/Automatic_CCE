In this set-up, several recently-proposed approaches have also reported competitive performances #REF . Now, we consider a different and more practical setup, where the starting point is using an already pre-trained language model #TARGET_REF . As such models were trained using vanilla attention, replacing it with a new attention variant typically requires a corrective pretraining stage to allow the model weights to adjust to the new variant, which can be expensive for large models. For example, #REF have shown that using random features without corrective pre-training leads to high error rates in a language modeling task. Moreover, as explained in Â§2.1, most past methods are incompatible with feed-forward layers. In the subsequent experiments we show that it is possible to replace vanilla with top-k attention, at multi-head attention and feed-forward layers, and perform inference and fine-tuning without any need for such correction.",

The reason for this phenomenon is closely related to the low sequence-level coordination of the generator. Specifically, increasing the beam width may introduce candidates with lower quality #TARGET_REF , and the generator may not be able to differentiate them from high-quality candidates. In Tab. 5, we compare the performance of the pre-trained BART and our model (BRIO-Mul) with different beam widths used during inference. We observe that the performance of BART goes down as the beam width increases. On the other hand, our model is able to achieve better performance with a larger number of beams, demonstrating that our training method can improve the coordination of the model by encouraging the model to assign estimated probabilities to candidate summaries wellcorrelated with their quality. Training with Different Evaluation Metrics In the previous experiments, we used ROUGE as the evaluation metric to define the target ordering of the candidate summaries (Eq.7). To evaluate our method's performance beyond ROUGE, we use a model-based semantic similarity metric, BERTScore #REF , 7 as the evaluation metric M in Eq.7 to compare the performance of different candidate summaries. Then, we trained another version of BRIO-Mul based on the order of candidate summaries calculated by BERTScore.",

In Table 3 (Top-3 column) we report the number of appearances of a model among the top 3 highest scoring models on at least one disentanglement metric. The ranking suggests that Î²-VAE with smaller Î² values reach better disentangled representations, and MAT-VAE performing superior on YNOC and poorly on POS, highlighting its more challenging nature. For MAT-VAE we also observe an interesting correlation between sparsity and disentanglement: for instance on YNOC, MAT-VAE (Î² = 0.01, Î» = 0.1) achieves the highest Hoyer (See Table 4) and occurs 7 times among Top-3 (see Table 3). Interestingly, the success of MAT-VAE does not translate to POS dataset, where it underperforms AE. These two observations suggest that sparsity could be a facilitator for disentanglement, but achieving a stable level of sparsity remains as a challenge. The more recent development in the direction of sparsity, HSVAE #TARGET_REF , addresses the stability issue of MAT-VAE but we leave its exploration to future work.",

At a coarse level, prior studies annotated the presence of particular argumentation schemes in text #REF and developed models to classify different schemes #TARGET_REF . However, each scheme often accommodates both support and attack relations between statements, so classifying those relations requires semantically richer information within the scheme than just its presence. To that end, #REF annotated individual components within schemes, particularly emphasizing argument from consequences. Based on the logic behind this scheme, #REF developed an unsupervised method to classify the support and attack relations using syntactic rules and lexicons. Our work extends these studies by including other normative schemes (practical reasoning and property-based reasoning) and annotating richer information.",

This makes it much easier for a computational parser to extract information from them. But the initial work in the current wave was done by #TARGET_REF at Texas using Webster's, an oldfashioned dinosaur of a dictionary.

To this end, participants were given access to a large pre-release dataset of approximately 250k explanatory relevancy ratings that augment the 2020 shared task data #TARGET_REF , and were tasked with ranking the facts most critical to assembling large explanations for a given question highest. Similarly to the previous instances of our competition, the shared task has been organized on the CodaLab platform. 1 We released train and development datasets along with the baseline solution in advance to allow one to get to know the task specifics. 2 We ran the practice phase from February 15 till March 9, 2021. Then we released the test dataset without answers and ran the official evaluation phase from March 10 till March 24, 2021. After that we established postcompetition phase to enable long-term evaluation of the methods beyond our shared task. Participating systems substantially increased task performance compared to a supplied baseline system by 32%, while achieving moderate overall absolute task performance -highlighting both the success of this shared task, as well as the continued challenge of determining relevancy in large multi-hop inference problems.",

System utterances are represented as low-dimensional latent variables by an auto-encoding task #TARGET_REF , and utterances with the same representations are considered to convey similar meanings. Such action representations might be prone to overdependence on the training data, which restricts the model generalization capability, especially when multiple domains are considered. This is because, without explicit supervision, the desired property of capturing the intentions of system utterances in the latent space cannot be enforced #REF , which in turn is due to the implicit nature of latent variables. For example, variational auto-encoder (VAE), which is often used for latent action learning, tends to produce a balanced distribution over the latent variables #REF , while the true distribution of system actions is highly imbalanced #REF . The resulting misaligned action representations would confuse the model of both steps and degenerate the sample efficiency in training.",

In (1a), the process adds un to the left of the stem clear. In (2a), the process changes the stem vowel of sing. In IP there are no morphemes but only lexemes and processes. In modern morphological theories both are represented, e.g. #REF for IA and #REF for IP. An important difference for our purposes is that in IA we have a tree structure whereas in IP we have a derivation history. A tree structure represents the relationship between morphemes, e.g. (3). A derivation history lists the different stages rules applying, e.g. ( 4). It should be noted that there are many variants of IA and IP. The reason we are interested in word formation rules is their productivity. Productivity is a difficult and controversial concept, cf. #REF . Basically, a productive word formation rule can be used to produce new lexical items. When a speaker has a productive word formation rule at her disposal, she can use a word not in her mental lexicon and be understood as far as other speakers have the same word formation rule available. The productivity of word formation makes it impossible to cover the entire lexicon in a finite list.",

For the designers of the detection method, explainability can serve as a principled mechanism for understanding and reasoning about the behavior of their method, which is important for multiple reasons. Firstly, if the detection method exhibits all the four properties of explain-ability, then the designers can easily gain insights into the factors that contributed to the decision made by the method given a comment. This can allow the designers to recognize when the method may be overly relying on a specific factor, e.g., the demographic traits. In the case of social feature engineering and user embeddings based methods, operationalization of explainability via feature attribution such as LIME #REF and Integrated Gradients #TARGET_REF can be effective in offering such insights. For social graph based methods that employ graph neural networks, attribution techniques like GNNExplainer #REF can be used instead. The second reason why explainability is important for the designers is because it can allow them to optimize the method by removing inputs that do not contribute significantly. Here again, explainability via feature attribution can be effective. Lastly, explainability is also important for the designers to understand how their method would perform in cases where a user may try obfuscate abusive language #REF . Counterfactual explanations can constitute an effective operationalization for the designers to identify the parts of their method that are most vulnerable to obfuscations.",

        "input": "in working with methods that incorporate user and community information is having datasets where comments come from users belonging to some limited demographics only. We refer to this as demographic bias. Datasets with demographic bias will cause the methods to overfit to linguistic practices and dialects of users and communities belonging to specific demographics #REF , hence diminishing the power of the methods to generalize. In fact, this bias is not only a problem for methods we discussed, but for any NLP method in general. When it comes to methods that incorporate user or community information specifically, there are two other biases that must be kept in mind when constructing datasets, we refer to them as comment distribution bias and label distribution bias. Comment distribution bias occurs when the majority of comments in the dataset come from a small number of unique users. Such datasets allow the methods to simply overfit to the linguistic or social behaviors and community roles of specific users #REF . Label distribution bias occurs when only the abusive comments of a user are included in the dataset. Abuse is a relatively infrequent phenomenon, even at an individual level #REF . Only getting abusive comments of a user can make the methods simply associate the identity of the user to abusiveness when including user information. Moreover, datasets with this bias can also make phenomena like homophily appear overly effective in the detection of abuse by sampling only abusive comments from users who are close in the social network.",

        "input": "10 An example of this type of work is #TARGET_REF . In Arabic a root such as ktb is combined with a vowel pattern to produce words such as kitaab ('book') and kutub ('books'). It is interesting to note that the traditional approach to Arabic roots results in approximately 10,000 different items. This number corresponds more closely to the number of simple lexemes to be expected in the lexicon of a language than to the number of lexemes. It is then not surprising to find items such as kaatib ('writer'), kutib ('be written') with the same root. 11 In principle we could of course reverse the entire system. Thus, languages such as Navajo, which use only prefixation, are not a major problem. 12 There is of course a different prefixation process attaching un-to a verb as in undo, but it would yield the wrong analysis for unacceptable. The word means 'which cannot be accepted', not 'which can be unaccepted'.",

Quoref is also created using an adversarial data collection method to discard examples that can be solved using simple lexical cues. The assumption is that it is hard to avoid simple lexical cues by which the model can answer questions without coreference reasoning. Therefore, an adversarial model (A) is used to discard examples that contain such lexical cues. While this adversarial filtering removes examples that are easy to solve by A, it does not ensure that the remaining examples do not contain shortcuts that are not explored by A. First, the adversarial model in Quoref is trained on another dataset, i.e., SQuAD. Thus, the failure of A on Quoref examples may be due to (1) Quoref having different lexical cues than those in SQuAD, or (2) domain shift. Second, and more importantly, as argued by #TARGET_REF , making the task challenging by focusing on examples that are more difficult for existing models is not a solution for more useful reading comprehension. 7 We instead propose a methodology for creating question-answer pairs as follows:",

This model updates its \"internal values\" and produces its final output by selecting from its memory cells with a self-attention mechanism. Leveraging an idea similar to that of image-based conditional GANs #REF , we introduce an external conditioning into the generator. First, given the conditioning input c 2 R d , the model computes an embedding t for c using functionf âœ“ : R d ! R m , with m &lt, d.Function f âœ“ has been implemented using a feed-forward neural network with a self-attention layer. The conditioning vector c may originate from any type of different source as long as it remains consistent during the individual training. Depending on the required task, as shown in the experiment phase, it will change. This vector c is the only link between the conditioning and the generative model, its influence on the final output will be crucial for the conditioning of the generated sentence. f âœ“ has been adopted to give the model the ability to learn the best manipulation of the conditioning vector to insert into the memory.",

To make a prediction if two mentions are coreferent, we compute sim cos (t 1 , t 2 ) over the type vectors for each mention and check if this is greater than a threshold, which we set to 0.5. Only our baselines use the CAP training set, our model does not train on this data. We compare our approach with the baselines described above as reported in #REF .

Recent work #TARGET_REF also reveals that attention scores outperform other explanation techniques in regularizing redundant information. Other techniques #REF can also be used in this step. As an example, given a sentence \"Spielberg is a good director.\", assuming \"good\" is a genuine token and \"Spielberg\" is a shortcut token, we expect that in a BERT-based sentiment classification model, the attention scores for \"good\" and \"Spielberg\" are higher and thus will be extracted as important tokens. On the other hand, for \"is\", \"a\" and \"director\" the attention scores would be lower as they are relatively less useful to the model decision.",

All baselines except MOST FREQUENT combine the classifier output and the prior probability to make a prediction: arg max c p prior (c) + p classifier (c) . 10 data. Our approach outperforms all baselines, indicating that our entity representations include useful information about entities out-of-the-box. Such a performance gap is expected since our entity representations can directly encode some factual knowledge from Wikipedia. However, these results also imply that pre-trained LMs do not have enough factual information out-of-the-box, they may rely on in-domain fine-tuning to achieve high performance in the target domain, and often fail to generalize to new settings. Note that while these accuracies are significantly below the supervised state-of-the-art (95%), they are competitive with the \"zero-shot\" entity results from recent past work #TARGET_REF .",

In particular, some NLP applications (speech recognition, speech to text, etc.) have some known problems related to network latency, transmission path difficulties, or privacy concerns. To reduce the impact of these communications, there is a solution that is to allow these models to run directly on peripheral or mobile devices, that is, in environments with limited resources that require lightweight, responsive models and energy efficiency.

Table 3 Besides our approach, we evaluated other graph models of different structures. First, we used the network graph developed by #REF . That graph does not use weight between the nodes. Second, we used the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) as weight instead of the average of embeddings. Third, we used bigrams and trigrams as nodes rather than token nodes. Finally, we used the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) measure #TARGET_REF as the weight between the bi and trigrams nodes. For these approaches, we adopted the same regularization algorithm, ranging the pre-labeled nodes from 5% to 30%. In Table 4, we present the bestachieved results. From this table, our graph modeling and the gradient boosting classifier achieved better results than these other graphs, as well as classifier variations. This, we think, is because of the embedding value among the graph nodes since it is able to capture morphological, syntactic, and semantic knowledge of a word. As we used the average word embedding value, it includes information from all of the individual vector values, working as an overall summary of all vector values.",

        "input": "In this paper we have presented a more fine-grained analysis of the Levin classes which highlights the semantic components entailed by certain syntactic frames, and hence the semantic components of entire classes of verbs. We hypothesize that the semantic components we are identifying will be useful for cross-linguistic generalizations. An important avenue of future research which we intend to explore is the comparison of the translations of these classes to independently-defined classes in other languages, such as French verb classes #TARGET_REF or European WordNet. 3 These cross-linguistic generalizations will be equally valuable for both transfer-based and interlinguabased approaches to machine translation. Presumably both approaches need to be augmented with pragmatic information about tense and aspect and information structure, in particular coreference, in order to provide an adequate basis for translation in many circumstances. It could be argued that a language-specific predicate-argument structure will lend itself more readily to language-specific pragmatic annotation than a language-independent one, but it would still be necessary to ensure that the pragmatic annotation was meaningful in the target languages as well, i.e., cross-linguistic. The discovery of cross-linguistic pragmatic features is an equally important area for future research.",

Natural language provides unique compositional structure while retaining the representation flexibility. These properties promote model generalization and thus make natural language a flexible representation for capturing characteristics with minimal assumptions #TARGET_REF . Motivated by these advantages, we learn natural language actions by identifying salient words of system utterances. Salient refers to indicative for a prediction task (e.g., sentiment analysis) that takes as input the original utterance. The main rationale is that the principal information that the task concerns can be preserved by just the salient words. For example, the sentiment of sentence \"The movie starts out as competent but turn bland\" can be revealed by the word \"bland\" when it is identified salient by considering the complete context. In our scenarios, we consider measuring word saliency in terms of state transitions. This is because state transitions reflect how the intentions of a system utterance influence the dialogue progress, and action representations that capture such influences can well reveal the intentions #REF . By considering salient words for state tracking tasks as actions, we obtain action representations that enjoy the merits of natural language and indeed capture the characteristics of interest, i.e., intentions of system utterances.",

Specifically, our system learns to assign each token of an utterance one of a finite set of abstract meaning fragments that are deterministically combined to give the meaning of the whole utterance. While our system may not fulfill all criteria of compositionality according to some definitions, it can arguably reap some of compositionality's benefits, which make it suitable for use in semi-automatic annotation workflows. We discuss this further in Section 5. Previous work has introduced trainable compositional semantic parsers for AMR #TARGET_REF and DRS #REF . In this paper, we improve upon the latter parser using a novel way to encode anchored DRSs as sequences, and thereby cast DRS parsing simply as a sequence labeling task ( Â§2). We use a standard transformer-based model to learn this task, followed by post-processing to ensure well-formed DRSs ( Â§3). We use training data from the Parallel Meaning Bank ( Â§4). The accuracy of our model approaches the state of the art with the additional benefit of being, to a degree, compositional ( Â§5). We give an error analysis in Â§6 and conclude in Â§7.",
