The study reveals marked differences in dopant incorporation in the films, which increases in the order: In, Al and Ga. The presence of dopant in the solution induces significant modifications in the deposition rate, which varies between 110 and 40\u00a0nm\u00a0min\u22121. All films are (002)-textured, whereas the lattice stress evolution with the dopant type and concentration suggests that Ga has the highest degree of substitutional incorporation in Zn sites. The average visible transmittance is higher than 80%, while the infrared reflectivity depends on the free carrier density in the films, which is the lowest for undoped ZnO and increases in the order: In-, Al- and Ga-doped ZnO. Optical measurements also yield an inverse correlation between carrier density and mobility. Doping enlarges the bandgap, as well as the Urbach energy that is related to the films\u2019 disorder. The lowest electrical resistivity, measured by four-point probe, is 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0\u03a9\u00a0cm and is obtained for In-doped films after being exposed to ultraviolet light.

These similar characteristics are reflected in, approximately, the same electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient values for both types of samples. However, in spite of similar power factor (PF) at low temperatures, it is slightly higher at high temperature for the attrition milled samples. On the other hand, the processing time reduction (from 38 to 2 h) when using attrition milled precursors, leads to lower mechanical properties in these samples. All these data clearly point out to the similar characteristics of both kinds of samples, with a drastic processing time decrease when using attrition milled precursors, which is of the main economic importance when considering their industrial production.", "doi": "10.1007/s40843-018-9339-1"}, {"title": "A MEMS-based thermal infrared emitter for an integrated NDIR spectrometer", "abstract": "A novel micromachined thermal infrared emitter using a heavily boron doped silicon slab as radiating element is presented.

All possible scattering events of hot electrons in the medium, the main details of the band structure, as well as the heating effects, are taken into account. The results presented in this study derive from numerical simulations of the electron dynamical response to the application of a sub-Thz electric field, fluctuating for the superimposition of an external source of Gaussian correlated noise. The electronic noise features are statistically investigated by computing the correlation function of the velocity fluctuations, its spectral density and the variance, i.e. the total noise power, for different values of amplitude and frequency of the driving field. Our results show the presence of a cooperative non-linear behavior of electrons, whose dynamics is strongly affected by the field fluctuations. Moreover, the electrons self-organize among different valleys, giving rise to the reduction of the intrinsic noise. This counterintuitive effect critically depends on the relationship among the characteristic times of the external fluctuations and the temporal scales of complex phenomena involved in the electron dynamical response. In particular, the correlation time of the electric field fluctuations appears to be crucial both for the noise reduction effect and the appearance of an anomalous diffusion effect.", "doi": "10.1016/j.chaos.2015.08.022"}, {"title": "Raman study of crystal-field excitations in Pr2\u2212x\n               Ce\n                  x\n               CuO4", "abstract": "Eleven Raman active crystal-field (CF) excitations involving 4f electrons are detected in Pr1.90Ce0.10CuO4 and Pr1.85Ce0.15CuO4.

In this work, the structure of Ni/ZnO:B/TaN is adopted and the ZnO:B film is deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited ZnO:B film is amorphous and becomes polycrystalline when annealing temperature is above 500 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdC. According to the analysis of conduction mechanism in the as-deposited ZnO:B devices, Ohmic conduction is obtained at positive bias voltage because of the Ohmic contact at the TaN/ZnO:B interface. Meanwhile, hopping conduction is obtained at negative bias voltage due to the defective traps in ZnO:B in which the trap energy level is lower than the energy barrier at the Ni/ZnO:B interface. In the hopping conduction, the temperature dependence of I-V characteristics reveals that the higher the temperature, the lower the current. This suggests that no single-level traps, but only multiple-level traps, exist in the amorphous ZnO:B films.

However, the potential of lanthanide doped upconverter materials is typically limited by low absorption coefficients and low upconversion quantum yields (UCQY) under practical irradiance of the excitation. Modifying the photonic environment can strongly enhance the spontaneous emission and therefore also the upconversion luminescence. Additionally, the non-linear nature of the upconversion processes can be exploited by an increased local optical field introduced by photonic or plasmonic structures. In combination, both processes may lead to a strong enhancement of the UCQY at simultaneously lower incident irradiances. Here, we use a comprehensive 3D computation-based approach to investigate how absorption, upconversion luminescence, and UCQY of an upconverter are altered in the vicinity of spherical gold nanoparticles (GNPs). We use Mie theory and electrodynamic theory to compute the properties of GNPs. The parameters obtained in these calculations were used as input parameters in a rate equation model of the upconverter \u03b2-NaYF4: 20% Er3+. We consider different diameters of the GNP and determine the behavior of the system as a function of the incident irradiance. Whether the UCQY is increased or actually decreased depends heavily on the position of the upconverter in respect to the GNP. Whereas the upconversion luminescence enhancement reaches a maximum around a distance of 35 nm to the surface of the GNP, we observe strong quenching of the UCQY for distances <40 nm and a UCQY maximum around 125 to 150 nm, in the case of a 300 nm diameter GNP. Hence, the upconverter material needs to be placed at different positions, depending on whether absorption, upconversion luminescence, or UCQY should be maximized. At the optimum position, we determine a maximum UCQY enhancement of 117% for a 300 nm diameter GNP at a low incident irradiance of 0.01 W/cm2. As the irradiance increases, the maximum UCQY enhancement decreases to 20% at 1 W/cm2.

Neutron-irradiated crystals contain oxygen vacancies, higher-order point defects, and interstitials, whereas thermochemically reduced (TCR) crystals contain oxygen vacancies. Comparison between a neutron irradiated and a TCR MgO crystal containing similar concentrations of oxygen vacancies, shows that 70% of the hardening by neutron irradiation is produced by interstitials, 30% by oxygen vacancies, and a negligible amount by higher-order point defects. \u00a9 2002 The American Physical Society.", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevB.66.024111"}, {"title": "Photo-oxidation of dope-dyed polypropylene fibres", "abstract": "The efficiencies of several light stabilizers have been evaluated in commercially manufactured polypropylene fibres.

The results show that in appropriate conditions (such as 60 \u00b0C/30 min), the composite can not only repair the electrical tree and scratches, but also restore the insulation strength of damaged area. The effect of doping microcapsules on the electrical performances of polyethylene, such as breakdown strength, volumetric resistivity, dielectric properties, and space charge characteristics, are mainly related to impurity and the interface of microcapsule. Polarization and ionization of impurities can reduce the electrical performance of polyethylene. The interface not only improves the microstructure of polyethylene (such as how the heterogeneous nucleation effect increases the number of crystal regions, and the anchoring effect enhances the stability of amorphous regions), but also increases the charge traps. Moreover, the microstructure and charge trap can affect the characteristics of carrier transport, material polarization, and space charge accumulation, thus improving the electrical performance of polyethylene.

This review article provides an overview of four main approaches to rational heterostructure design: coupling \u03b1-Fe2O3 with (1) an n- or p-type semiconductor for promoting charge separation; (2) a nanotextured conductive substrate for efficient charge collection; (3) a surface/interface passivation layer for reduced surface/interface charge recombination; (4) a catalyst for accelerated water oxidation kinetics. The achievements to date demonstrate that high PEC performance may be accessed with these designs. In addition, we review time-resolved laser techniques used to probe the charge carrier dynamics of these heterostructures. Dynamic studies have provided insight into the mechanisms responsible for the improved PEC performance in these materials and helped to guide continued design of \u03b1-Fe2O3 heterostructures for further enhancement of PEC water splitting. As summarized in this review article, rational heterostructure design is a promising strategy to push forward the application of \u03b1-Fe2O3 for potential low cost and high efficiency solar hydrogen conversion. A better fundamental understanding of the charge carrier dynamics in these structures in turn helps to guide and improve the heterostructure design.", "doi": "10.1039/C6EE01845A"}, {"title": "Broad spectral inhibitory effects of pale green zinc oxide nanophosphor on bacterial and fungal pathogens", "abstract": "Nd3+ doped zinc oxide nanophosphor were prepared by a modified sonochemical route.

The barrier height can be adjusted by changing the doping concentration in the contact region of BIB detectors. A new dark-current-blocking mechanism is proposed that the interfacial barriers can block the transport of carriers at low temperatures. Moreover, the greater the barrier height, the stronger the blocking effect. Utilizing this new blocking mechanism, the ${I}$ - ${V}$ characteristics of Ge:B BIB detectors can be better explained. By increasing the barrier heights, the dark current is reduced significantly, almost six orders of magnitude within a certain voltage range, and the working temperature is increased from the usual 4.2-10 K, which is of great significance for extending the service life of BIB detectors on outer space observation platforms.

Steady-state current-voltage properties and quasi-Fermi level positions under illumination", "abstract": "The behavior of the quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes at various semiconductor/liquid interfaces has been probed through the use of thin, high purity, low dopant density single crystal Si photoelectrodes. Since standard Air Mass 1.5 illumination is sufficient to produce high level injection conditions in such samples, minimal electric fields can be present near the solid/liquid interface. Under these conditions, efficient charge separation relies on establishment of kinetic asymmetries at the back contacts while effectively sustaining photogenerated carrier concentration gradients in the photoelectrode. These conditions were achieved for Si/CH3OH interfaces in contact with the 1,1\u2032-dimethylferrocene+/0, cobaltocene+/0, methyl viologen2+/+, and decamethylferrocene+/0 redox couples. For redox couples having energies near the top of the Si valence band, such as 1,1\u2032-dimethylferrocene+/0, the sample acted like an n-type photoelectrode, yielding large photovoltages for collection of electrons at the back contact and small photovoltages for collection of holes. For redox couples having energies near the bottom of the Si conduction band, such as cobaltocene+/0, the sample acted like a p-type photoelectrode, yielding large photovoltages for collection of holes at the back contact and small photovoltages for collection of electrons. The Si sample exhibited both photoanodic and photocathodic currents in contact with redox couples having electrochemical potentials in the middle of the Si band gap. A simple explanation, based on the fundamental carrier statistics of semiconductor/liquid contacts under illumination relative to the situation at equilibrium, is advanced to describe this behavior. This explanation is also applicable to a description of the photovoltage behavior of semiconductor particles and to undoped photoconductive semiconductor electrodes that are operated under high level injection conditions. In additional experiments, measurement of the apparent electrochemical potentials of electrons and holes in contact with various redox couples has allowed quantification of the amount of recombination and experimental determination of the separation of the quasi-Fermi levels for various redox couples at the semiconductor/ liquid contact.

Our analysis spans a range of Mn concentrations and considers the presence of compensating defects such as As antisites. In the defect-free case all the heterostructures studied present a half-metallic electronic structure. In contrast, when As antisites are present the half-metallic state is destroyed and the heterostructures behave as dirty planar metals. In this case they show a large p-type metallic conductance in the Mn plane mainly due to majority spin electrons, and an n-type hopping like conductance in the GaAs planes mainly due to minority spin electrons. This suggests that if the As antisites can be kept far from the Mn planes, spatial separation of the different spin currents can be achieved. Finally, we show that in the case of AlAs/(Ga, Mn)As digital ferromagnetic heterostructures the AlAs/GaAs valence band offset produces an additional confining potential for the holes responsible for the ferromagnetism. Therefore the ferromagnetic coupling between the Mn ions becomes larger and more robust to the presence of As antisites. \u00a9 2003 The American Physical Society.", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevB.68.054425"}, {"title": "Photocurrent-action spectrum of anthracene: Tetracene mixed crystal ", "abstract": "The photocurrent-action spectrum of an anthracene crystal doped with tetracene (in a concentration of 10\u22125) exhibits the tetracene singlet exciton absorption spectrum.

Alloying on the cation (A) site is a frequently used approach to optimize the thermoelectric transport properties of AM 2 X 2 compounds, and complete solid solubility has been reported for many combinations of cations. In the present study, we investigate the phase stability of the AMg 2 Sb 2 system with mixed occupancy of Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba on the cation (A) site.

In this crystal, protons mainly reside around Y dopants due to the electrostatic attractive interaction between the dopants and protons, which is well known as proton trapping. In the case of the typical doping level x \u223c 0.2 in BaZr1-xYxO3-\u03b4, the existence of Y-Y-Y triplets with a triangular configuration is an origin of the strong proton-trapping effect, in which protons are transferred in an oscillatory manner between two adjacent sites.

At the typical doping level with dense dopants, protons preferentially migrate along the three-dimensional network of Y dopants throughout the crystal without detrapping.

The ionization-induced spontaneous defect recovery is discussed in terms of the activation-energy lowering of the higher-charge-state interstitials. We suggest that inner-shell vacancies which decay by an Auger process may induce most effective self-annealing of defects created by nuclear collisions. We present an ion-lattice single-collision model which describes the production and saturation of the primary defects (interstitial, vacancy, and antisite defect) in GaAs under MeV ion or MeV electron irradiation. The model also shows that at low beam dose the concentration of interstitials and vacancies increases linearly with the product of stopping power and beam dose and is independent of the electronic stopping power. The antisite defect concentration increases initially as the square of the nuclear stopping power times the beam dose, and depends upon the electronic stopping power. The strain measured as a function of beam dose and stopping powers suggests that the strain in the room-temperature irradiated GaAs is controlled by the antisite defects. \u00a9 1986 The American Physical Society.", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevB.33.4083"}, {"title": "Ultralow-voltage electric double-layer SnO<inf>2</inf> nanowire transistors gated by microporous SiO<inf>2</inf>-based solid electrolyte", "abstract": "Ultralow-voltage individual Sb-doped SnO2 nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs) gated by microporous SiO2-based solid electrolyte are fabricated by using nickel grid as a shadow mask.

In this paper, a cyclic fatigue test was conducted on individual real solder joints of different alloys, including SnAgCu, SnCu-Bi, SnAgCu-Bi, and SnAgCu-BiSb. The fatigue property of those solder joints was analyzed based on the characteristic fatigue life and stress-strain, hysteresis, loops. The results show that solder joints with both Ag and Bi content have a better fatigue resistance than the solder joints with Ag or Bi content only. The results of SnAgCu and SnCu-Bi solder alloys show similar fatigue performance. Also, the fatigue performance of SnAgCu-Bi is close to SnAgCu-BiSb in the accelerated test. But the SnAgCu-Bi alloy is estimated to have a longer characteristic life under low-stress amplitude cycling. The microstructure analysis shows a bismuth-rich phase formed around the Ag3Sn precipitates. Adding bismuth in the solder alloy can significantly improve the fatigue properties through solid solution hardenings. On another hand, the plastic strain range and work dissipation were measured from the hysteresis loops for all tests. The Morrow Energy and the Coffin-Manson models were developed from the fitted data to predict the fatigue life as a function of work dissipation and plastic strain range.", "doi": "10.1115/1.4047341"}, {"title": "Spiral attractor created by vector solitons", "abstract": "Mode-locked lasers emitting a train of femtosecond pulses called dissipative solitons are an enabling technology for metrology, high-resolution spectroscopy, fibre optic communications, nano-optics and many other fields of science and applications.

The modified Allan deviation reaches 3 \u00d7 10-19 at an averaging time of 100 s. Beyond 100 s it follows the interferometer noise floor, and for averaging times longer than 1000 s the modified Allan deviation is in the 10-20 range.

The coupling between ferroelectricity and the piezo-phototronic effect may lead to the design of distinctive photoelectric devices with multifunctional features. Here, we report an enhancement of the photovoltaic performances in the ferroelectric p-type La-doped bismuth ferrite film (BLFO)/n-type zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire array heterojunction by rationally coupling the strain-induced piezoelectricity in ZnO nanowires and the ferroelectricity in BLFO. Under a compressive strain of -2.3% and a 10 V upward poling of the BLFO, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the device increase by 8.4% and 54.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the rise (/decay) time is modulated from 153.7 (/108.8) to 61.28 (/74.86) ms. Systematical band diagram analysis reveals that the promotion of photogenerated carriers and boost of the photovoltaic performances of the device can be attributed to the modulated carrier transport behaviors at the BLFO/ZnO interface and the superposed driving forces arising from the adding up of the piezoelectric potential and ferroelectric polarization. In addition, COMSOL simulation results of piezopotential distribution in ZnO nanowire arrays and the energy band structure change of the heterojunction further confirm the mechanisms. This work not only presents an approach to design high-performance ferroelectric photovoltaic devices but also further broadens the research scope of piezo-phototronics.", "doi": "10.1021/acsnano.0c05398"}, {"title": "Urchin-like Al-Doped Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> Nanospheres Rich in Surface Oxygen Vacancies Enable Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis", "abstract": "Developing cost-efficient electrocatalysts for ambient N2-to-NH3 conversion and revealing the reaction mechanism are appealing yet challenging tasks. Some transition metal oxides have been recently used to catalyze the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), but their further applications are greatly impeded because of their questionable conductivity, poor dispersion, limited active sites, and so forth. Herein, three-dimensional Ni foam-supported urchin-like Al-doped Co3O4 nanospheres rich in surface oxygen vacancies (Al-Co3O4/NF) were prepared via a hydrothermal process and subsequent annealing treatment. It is shown that introducing Al atoms into Co3O4 effectively tunes the electronic properties of the catalyst, and the increased surface oxygen vacancies induced by Al doping facilitate the activation of nitrogen. What is more, this urchin-like nanostructure, demonstrating an ability to limit the coalescence of gas bubbles, enables the rapid removal of small gas bubbles and better exposure of active sites to N2, thus yielding an impressive ammonia electrosynthesis activity (NH3 yield rate: 6.48 \u00d7 10-11 mol s-1 cm-2 Faradaic efficiency: 6.25%) in 0.1 M KOH.

The thermal expansion coefficient of YSZ was theoretically estimated for the various Y2O3 contents using the values of isochoric heat capacity, molar volume, isothermal bulk modulus and the Gruneisen constant in a good agreement with the experimental results.

This paper reviews the recent progress in germanium (Ge) spintronics on the basis of the electrical spin injection from ferromagnets (FM), where Ge is a next generation semiconductor for applications such as CMOS and optical communication on the silicon platform. In general, four-terminal nonlocal voltage measurements in FM-Ge lateral spin-valve devices are important to discuss the spin transport and spin relaxation in n-Ge. First, to obtain relatively low contact resistance compared to the FM/MgO/Ge contacts, we introduce the formation of high-quality FM/Ge heterointerfaces with a phosphorus \u03b4-doped Ge layer, where the atomic arrangement matching at the interface between the (1 1 1) surface of body-centered cubic FMs and Ge(1 1 1) is important. Next, we explain electrical detections of the spin transport in degenerate n-Ge. Owing to the Heusler alloy/Ge Schottky-tunnel barrier contacts, we obtain relatively large spin signals compared to those detected by using conventional CoFe contacts. Furthermore, we can experimentally determine the spin diffusion length and the spin lifetime in degenerate n-Ge by quantitatively analyzing the contact-distance dependence of the spin signals and the Hanle-effect curves. Since we can clarify the temperature dependence of the spin lifetime from 8 to 296 K, the spin relaxation mechanism in n-Ge can be understood as a consequence of the intervalley spin-flip scattering in the conduction band. We propose an advantage over GaAs systems by comparing the spin lifetimes between Ge and GaAs at around room temperature. Finally, we describe future prospects of Ge spintronics, including vertically fabricated device structures such as vertical spin MOSFETs and spin LEDs.", "doi": "10.1088/1361-6463/aad542"}, {"title": "Resonant tunneling structures based on epitaxial graphene on SiC", "abstract": "Recently some experiments have suggested that graphene epitaxially grown on SiC can exhibit an energy bandgap of 260 meV, which enhances the potential of this material for electronic applications.

The non-equilibrium Green's function technique for solving the massive Dirac model is applied to highlight typical transport phenomena such as the electron confinement and the resonant tunneling effects. The I-V characteristics of graphene resonant tunneling diodes were then investigated and the effect of different device parameters was discussed.

The solvent played a significant role in the formation of the 3D flower-like BiOI microarchitectures with respect to temperature and time. The phase formation of the synthesized BiOI samples was examined by X-ray diffraction analysis, which confirmed a characteristic tetragonal crystal structure with the space group of P4/nmm.
