The error rate on sentence boundaries in the Brown corpus was not significantly worse than the lowest quoted before (#REF: 0.28% vs. 0.20% error rate). On the WSJ corpus our system performed slightly better than the combination of the Alembic and SATZ systems described in #TARGET_REF ( 0.44 % vs. 0.5 % error rate ) . Although these error rates seem to be very small, they are quite significant. Unlike general POS tagging, in which it is unfair to expect an error rate of less than 2% because even human annotators have a disagreement rate of about 3%, sentence boundaries are much less ambiguous (with a disagreement of about 1 in 5,000). This shows that an error rate of 1 in 200 (0.5%) is still far from reaching the disagreement level. On the other hand, one error in 200 periods means that there is one error in every two documents in the Brown corpus and one error in every four documents in the WSJ corpus.",

First of all, iteration would increase the complexity of building a model of a paragraph; infinite iteration would almost certainly make impossible such a construction in real time. Secondly , the cooperative principle of #TARGET_REF , 1978 ) , under the assumption that referential levels of a writer and a reader are quite similar , implies that the writer should structure the text in a way that makes the construction of his intended model easy for the reader ; and this seems to imply that he should appeal only to the most direct knowledge of the reader . Finally, it has been shown by #REF that the ratio of derived to explicit information necessary for understanding a piece of text is about 8:1; furthermore, our reading of the analysis of five paragraphs by #REF strongly suggests that only the most direct or obvious inferences are being made in the process of building a model or constructing a theory of a paragraph. Thus, for example, we can expect that in the worst case only one or two steps of such an iteration would be needed to find answers to wh-questions.",

The analysis of the data we have collected indicates that student satisfaction may be affected if the system rephrases student answers using different words (for example, using better terminology) but doesn't explicitly explain the reason why different terminology is needed (#REF). Results from other systems show that measures of semantic coherence between a student and a system were positively associated with higher learning gain ( #TARGET_REF ) . Using a deep generator to automatically generate system feedback gives us a level of control over the output and will allow us to devise experiments to study those issues in more detail.",

Few established parsing systems have substantial lexicons and even those which employ very comprehensive grammars (eg. #REF;#REF) consult relatively small lexicons, typically generated by hand. Two exceptions to this generalisation are the Linguistic String Project ( #TARGET_REF ) and the IBM CRITIQUE ( formerly EPISTLE ) Project ( #REF ; #REF ) ; the former employs a dictionary of approximately 10,000 words , most of which are specialist medical terms , the latter has well over 100,000 entries , gathered from machine readable sources . In addition, there are a number of projects under way to develop substantial lexicons from machine readable sources (see #REF for details). However, as yet few results have been published concerning the utility of electronic versions of published dictionaries as sources for such lexicons.",

This is because the aim of the COMLEX project was to construct as complete a set of subcategorization frames as possible, even for infrequent verbs. Lexicographers were allowed to extrapolate from the citations found, a procedure which is bound to be less certain than the assignment of frames based entirely on existing examples. As a generalization, #REF notes that lexicons such as COMLEX tend to demonstrate high precision but low recall. #TARGET_REF report on manually analyzing an open-class vocabulary of 35,000 head words for predicate subcategorization information and comparing the results against the subcategorization details in COMLEX . Precision was quite high (95%), but recall was low (84%). This has an effect on both the precision and recall scores of our system against COMLEX.",

Recent work by #TARGET_REF on the filtering phase of this approach uses linguistic verb classes ( based on Levin [ 1993 ] ) for obtaining more accurate back-off estimates for hypothesis selection . #REF use a handwritten head-lexicalized, context-free grammar and a text corpus to compute the probability of particular subcategorization patterns. The approach is iterative with the aim of estimating the distribution of subcategorization frames associated with a particular predicate. They perform a mapping between their frames and those of the OALD, resulting in 15 frame types. These do not contain details of specific prepositions.",

Text classification was used to group request e-mails into broad categories, some of which, such as requests for financial reports, can be automatically addressed. The question-answering approach and the retrieval component of the case-based reasoning approach were data driven, using word-level matches. However, the personalization component of the case-based reasoning approach was rule-based (e.g., rules were applied to substitute names of individuals and companies in texts).",

In the above example, this would result in two lexical rules: one for words with tl as their c value and one for those with t2 as their c value. In the latter case, we can also take care of transferring the value of z. However , as discussed by #TARGET_REF , creating several instances of lexical rules can be avoided . Instead, the disjunctive possibilities introduced by the frame specification are attached as a constraint to a lexical rule. This is accomplished by having each lexical rule predicate call a so-called framepredicate,which can have multiple defining clauses. So for the lexical rule 1, the frame specification is taken care of by extending the predicate in Figure 6 with a call to a frame predicate, as shown in Figure 8.17",

Briefly, the goal of MD is to identify the boundary of a mention, its mention type (e.g., pronoun, name), and its semantic type (e.g., person, location). Unlike them, (1) we do not perform the full MD task, as our goal is to investigate the role of SC knowledge in coreference resolution; and (2) we do not use the ACE training data for acquiring our SC classifier; instead, we use the BBN Entity Type Corpus ( #TARGET_REF ) , which consists of all the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal articles with the ACE mentions manually identified and annotated with their SCs. This provides us with a training set that is approximately five times bigger than that of ACE. More importantly, the ACE participants do not evaluate the role of induced SC knowledge in coreference resolution: many of them evaluate coreference performance on perfect mentions (e.g., #REF); and for those that do report per- formance on automatically extracted mentions, they do not explain whether or how the induced SC information is used in their coreference algorithms.",

Therefore, after lifting the common information into the extended lexical entry, the out-argument in many cases contains enough information to permit a postponed execution of the interaction predicate. When C is the common information, and D1, ..., Dk are the definitions of the interaction predicate called, we use distributivity to factor out C in (C A D1) V -.. V (C A Dk): We compute C A (D1 V ... V Dk), where the r) are assumed to contain no further common factors. Once we have computed c, we use it to make the extended lexical entry more specific. This technique closely resembles the off-line constraint propagation technique described by Marriott, Naish, and #REF. The reader is referred to #TARGET_REF for a more detailed discussion of our use of constraint propagation.",

However, due to the very large sets of potential supertags used in a parse, computing inside charts is intractable, so we design a Metropolis-Hastings step that allows us to sample efficiently from the correct posterior.
