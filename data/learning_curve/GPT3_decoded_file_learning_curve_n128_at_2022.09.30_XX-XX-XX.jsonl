The results presented in this study derive from numerical simulations of the electron dynamical response to the application of a sub-Thz electric field, fluctuating for the superimposition of an external source of Gaussian correlated noise. The electronic noise features are statistically investigated by computing the correlation function of the velocity fluctuations, its spectral density and the variance, i.e. the total noise power, for different values of amplitude and frequency of the driving field. Our results show the presence of a cooperative non-linear behavior of electrons, whose dynamics is strongly affected by the field fluctuations. Moreover, the electrons self-organize among different valleys, giving rise to the reduction of the intrinsic noise. This counterintuitive effect critically depends on the relationship among the characteristic times of the external fluctuations and the temporal scales of complex phenomena involved in the electron dynamical response.

Under these conditions, the well-known instability of this material against carbon dioxide and humidity can be minimized, potentially allowing its application even in hydrocarbon-based atmospheres. Nonetheless, electrochemical transport properties of grain boundaries of BCY are still not well understood. Hence, we compare specific grain boundary conductivity and space-charge properties of BaCe0\u00b79Y0\u00b71O3-\u03b4 (BCY10) in both wet and low humidity by means of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 100\u2013300 \u00b0C. In H2, specific grain boundary conductivity increases in nominally dry conditions, while the bulk remains practically humidity independent. Conversely, in O2, both bulk and specific grain boundary conductivities are higher in wet. The space-charge properties highlight that low levels of humidity, pH2O ~10\u22124 atm, are sufficient to maintain functional performance, while providing enough stability.

presents the results of a study of radiation energy storage, radiation effects, and radiation induced changes of optical properties in crystals KH2PO4 (KDP), (NH4)H2PO4 (ADP), and crystals KDP doped with either deuterium (KDP:D) or Cr (KDP:Cr). Both the X-rays and H+(0.71MeV),He+(4.6 and 27MeV),N+(16MeV) ion beams were used for irradiation of the crystals studied. Optical absorption spectra of KDP were measured after irradiation with various H+ ion beam doses, and accumulation of the radiation-induced defects was estimated. Considerations of the radiation effects in these crystals under irradiation with the ion beams were made taking into account the results of Monte Carlo simulations using the TRIM computer codes.

operating with subwavelength spatial resolution is presented. The active region of this detector is defined by the pn-interface region of a highly doped GaAs homojunction. The cleavage plane normal to the interface defines a line detector with high spatial resolution. The actual resolution was tested using a near-field scanning optical microscope. An Al-coated tapered optical fiber of nominal aperture of 60 nm was scanned in the optical near-field vicinity across the active region of the junction. The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction. The width of the observed peak in photocurrent is found to be highly asymmetric with respect to the p or n side of the junction. The reason for this asymmetry is discussed in terms of diffusion length of minority carriers in the n- and p-GaAs close to the suface. \u00a9 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
