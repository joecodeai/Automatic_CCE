The fabrication process has been designed to allow the integration of such infrared emitters with an array of thermopile infrared detectors, with the aim of achieving an integrated non-dispersive infrared microspectrometer. A first set of infrared emitters with a common size for the doped silicon radiating slab (1,100 \u00d7 300 \u00d7 8 \u03bcm3) has been successfully fabricated and characterized. The working temperature of the Jouleheated radiating slabs has been controlled by means of DC and pulsed electrical signals, achieving temperatures well beyond 700\u00b0C. The thermal time constant measured in pulsed operation, around 50 ms, is adequate to enable the direct electrical modulation of the emitted radiation up to a frequency of 5 Hz while maintaining the full modulation depth.

The electronic noise features are statistically investigated by computing the correlation function of the velocity fluctuations, its spectral density and the variance, i.e. the total noise power, for different values of amplitude and frequency of the driving field. Our results show the presence of a cooperative non-linear behavior of electrons, whose dynamics is strongly affected by the field fluctuations. Moreover, the electrons self-organize among different valleys, giving rise to the reduction of the intrinsic noise. This counterintuitive effect critically depends on the relationship among the characteristic times of the external fluctuations and the temporal scales of complex phenomena involved in the electron dynamical response.

Under these conditions, the well-known instability of this material against carbon dioxide and humidity can be minimized, potentially allowing its application even in hydrocarbon-based atmospheres. Nonetheless, electrochemical transport properties of grain boundaries of BCY are still not well understood. Hence, we compare specific grain boundary conductivity and space-charge properties of BaCe0\u00b79Y0\u00b71O3-\u03b4 (BCY10) in both wet and low humidity by means of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 100\u2013300 \u00b0C. In H2, specific grain boundary conductivity increases in nominally dry conditions, while the bulk remains practically humidity independent. Conversely, in O2, both bulk and specific grain boundary conductivities are higher in wet. The space-charge properties highlight that low levels of humidity, pH2O ~10\u22124 atm, are sufficient to maintain functional performance, while providing enough stability.

The active region of this detector is defined by the pn-interface region of a highly doped GaAs homojunction. The cleavage plane normal to the interface defines a line detector with high spatial resolution. The actual resolution was tested using a near-field scanning optical microscope. An Al-coated tapered optical fiber of nominal aperture of 60 nm was scanned in the optical near-field vicinity across the active region of the junction. The photocurrent was measured as a function of the position of the fiber tip relative to the cleaved GaAs pn-junction. The width of the observed peak in photocurrent is found to be highly asymmetric with respect to the p or n side of the junction. The reason for this asymmetry is discussed in terms of diffusion length of minority carriers in the n- and p-GaAs close to the suface. \u00a9 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.
